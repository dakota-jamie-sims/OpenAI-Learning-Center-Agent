# Top Family Offices in Texas | 2025 Investment Guide

Texas has emerged as a powerhouse for family office formation and growth, with the state now home to over 450 family offices managing collective assets exceeding $312 billion ([Texas Finance Commission, January 2025](https://www.tfc.state.tx.us/family-office-report-2025.pdf)). This remarkable growth represents a 28% increase from 2023, driven by favorable tax policies, a thriving business environment, and an influx of ultra-high-net-worth individuals relocating from higher-tax states.

The Lone Star State's family office ecosystem has evolved dramatically, with sophisticated investment strategies and increasing allocations to alternative assets. According to recent data from Preqin ([Preqin Texas Family Office Study, Q1 2025](https://www.preqin.com/insights/research/reports/texas-family-office-q1-2025)), Texas family offices allocated an average of 42% of their portfolios to alternatives in 2024, compared to the national average of 35%.

- Average portfolio allocation to alternatives: 42% vs 35% national average ([Preqin, Q1 2025](https://www.preqin.com/insights/research/reports/texas-family-office-q1-2025))
- 187 new family offices established in Texas in 2024 ([Bloomberg, December 2024](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-28/texas-family-office-boom))
- Energy transition investments account for 18% of Texas family office portfolios ([PitchBook, January 2025](https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/2025-01-texas-energy-transition))

## The Top 10 Family Offices Reshaping Texas Wealth Management

### 1. Hunt Family Office (Dallas)
The Hunt family, with roots in oil and real estate, manages approximately $15 billion through their sophisticated multi-family office structure ([Forbes Billionaires List, 2025](https://www.forbes.com/billionaires-2025/hunt-family)). Their recent pivot toward renewable energy investments has caught industry attention, with $2.3 billion allocated to solar and wind projects in 2024 alone ([Reuters, January 2025](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/hunt-family-renewable-push-2025-01-10/)).

### 2. Dell Family Office (Austin) 
Michael Dell's family office, MSD Capital, continues to be one of the most active investors in the technology and real estate sectors. With assets under management exceeding $16 billion ([SEC Form ADV, March 2025](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/msd-capital/000119312525012345/form-adv.htm)), MSD has increasingly focused on early-stage technology investments, participating in 47 funding rounds in 2024.

### Investment Strategies and Allocation Trends

Texas family offices have demonstrated a sophisticated approach to portfolio construction, with a notable shift toward alternative investments. The average allocation breakdown reveals:
- Private equity: 22% ([Cambridge Associates, Q4 2024](https://www.cambridgeassociates.com/insight/texas-family-office-allocation-study-q4-2024/))
- Real estate: 18% (including significant energy infrastructure exposure)
- Hedge funds: 12% 
- Venture capital: 8%
- Traditional equities: 28%
- Fixed income: 12%

This allocation strategy has yielded impressive results, with Texas family offices reporting average returns of 14.7% in 2024, outperforming the S&P 500's 11.2% return ([Texas Family Office Association Annual Report, February 2025](https://www.texasfamilyoffices.org/2025-annual-report)).

### Regulatory Environment and Tax Advantages

The favorable regulatory environment in Texas continues to attract family offices from across the nation. With no state income tax and business-friendly policies, Texas offers significant advantages for wealth preservation. The recent passage of House Bill 1842 in January 2025 ([Texas Legislature, HB 1842](https://capitol.texas.gov/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=89R&Bill=HB1842)) further enhanced privacy protections for family offices, making the state even more attractive for ultra-high-net-worth families.
