    "title": "Investment RFPs Announced in September 2024",
    "introduction": "As we navigated through September, the investment landscape continued to see a diverse array of RFPs from institutional investors across different asset classes. From global equity mandates and emerging markets to value-add real estate and U.S. fixed income, there were numerous opportunities for investors and managers alike. This month, we highlight significant RFPs, including an up to $1.5 billion global equity search by the Kansas Public Employees Retirement System and a $5 billion passive U.S. equity mandate from the New York State Deferred Compensation Board. We’ll also cover other key opportunities, like the City of Holyoke Retirement Board’s international equity search and Cambridge Retirement System’s focus on timber and farmland. For investors, consultants, and asset managers, these RFPs present a chance to align with new investment opportunities. Review the details, meet the deadlines, and position yourself to seize these opportunities in an evolving market. In this blog, we bring you a comprehensive list of RFPs that were issued in the month of September from various sectors including Private Real Estate, Fixed Income, Emerging Markets, Fixed Income, and more.
