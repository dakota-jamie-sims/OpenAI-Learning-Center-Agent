    "title": "April 2024 Financial Advisor and RIA Moves and Acquisitions",
    "introduction": "The RIA industry has experienced significant growth, particularly among large RIAs with assets over $1 billion, which now control more than 80% of RIA client assets. This dominance has led to increased valuations for these firms, as they receive higher valuation multiples due to their substantial size growth. This trend has made big RIA acquirers more selective, thereby creating opportunities for midsize firms. In terms of advisor recruitment, LPL Financial reported a record-breaking first quarter in 2024, with $20 billion in recruited assets from January through March, marking its most successful recruiting quarter to date. At the end of April, Dakota documented roughly 40 transactions, and you can see these all in Dakota Marketplace. In this article, we're reporting the 40 transactions we saw so you are in the know. By the end of this, you'll have a better understanding of the shifts this past April. One of the larger acquisitions this month, Cerity Partners has merged with Denver-based Agility, the investment outsourcing branch of Perella Weinberg Partners (PWP). Agility, serving as an outsourced chief investment officer (OCIO) for nonprofits, university foundations, and wealthy families, managed approximately $15 billion in assets. Through the transition, Cerity Partners will now manage approximately $100 billion in assets. The merger enhances Cerity Partners' OCIO capabilities, with Agility known for its exceptional services in this area. The deal is expected to close in June, with Agility to be rebranded as Cerity Partners OCIO. Agility's leadership includes Chris Bittman, former CIO of the University of Colorado Foundation, and Deputy CIO Kent Muckel, former CIO of Baylor University.Cerity specializes in serving ultra-high net worth clients and has a history of merging with other RIAs and service providers catering to this demographic. This transaction with Agility marks Cerity Partners' first in 2024. The merger is part of Cerity Partners' growth strategy and enhances its service offerings. Cerity aims to keep Agility's investment research and processes that contributed to its growth within PWP. One of the larger moves this month, Cresset has expanded its San Francisco presence by acquiring two advisory teams formerly associated with J.P. Morgan Wealth Management and originally from First Republic Bank. These teams include three lead advisors and 12 additional financial professionals, managing a combined total of approximately $5 billion in assets. One of the teams, consisting of 10 members, is led by Dagny Maidman, who recently joined Cresset.

Her team has been together for approximately 10 years and includes associates with CFA designations and two Certified Financial Planners. They are known for their ability to create comprehensive solutions for ultra-high-net-worth clients. The second team, comprising five members, is directed by Chris Chase and Erik Ralston, who each have more than 20 years of industry experience. Chase, who joined First Republic in October 2015, was a managing director there until its acquisition by JP Morgan.
