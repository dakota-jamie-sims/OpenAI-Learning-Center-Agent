    "introduction": "One of the biggest challenges faced by alternative investment sales professionals within the fund of fund channel is knowing the underlying fund’s area of focus, and who to call on. As fund of funds differentiate themselves based on their skill of identifying, evaluating, and monitoring managers, they often have a large number of specialized analysts with an often global footprint. Fund of funds are often able to invest early, move quicker, and allocate larger amounts than many other allocators and should be a key area of focus for every alternative strategy across its lifecycle.

To help you narrow down the size of the channel, we’ve put together a list of the six largest fund of fund platforms that focus on hedge fund strategies. By the end of this article, you will have a better idea of the channel, as well as who might be the right people for you and your team to call on. 1.
