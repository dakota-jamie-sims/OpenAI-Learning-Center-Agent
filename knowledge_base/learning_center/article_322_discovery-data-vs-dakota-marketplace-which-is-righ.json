    "introduction": "It can be overwhelming to try and find the right institutional investor database for your business. Even a cursory search will show that there are dozens of databases to choose from, each promising to end your sales teams’ problems by delivering the data and leads needed to drive your goals home. Each one focuses on a different channel and provides a different level of insight — so where do you start? At the end of the day, you’re looking to drive results for your business, and to save your sales team from doing the administrative heavy-lifting that comes with prospecting and setting meetings. In the investment sales industry, the database question often comes down to a few key players, and it is not uncommon for a firm to narrow their search down to a handful of contenders. Typically, these include Discovery Data and Preqin, along with us here at Dakota Marketplace. We’ve said before that the word database has become almost taboo in our industry, and we think it’s wrongfully so. For that reason — and because we believe that building trust is the key to any new business partnership — we have no hesitations about giving an overview of the main differences and features between us and one of our main competitors so that you can make the best decision based on what you’re looking to achieve for your business.
