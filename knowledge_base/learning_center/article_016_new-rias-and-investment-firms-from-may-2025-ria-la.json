    "introduction": "We are pleased to present the Monthly Report of Newly Formed RIAs - May 2025. We are continuously blown away by the large number of newly created RIAs from the SEC report with a total of 220. As part of our monthly process, our data team reviewed and scrubbed this month’s raw file of 220 new filings, identifying 85 new wealth manager RIAs and 57 new investment firm RIAs. We then researched the appropriate contacts and related information before uploading everything to Dakota Marketplace. May 2025 marked a sharp uplift in SEC registrations: 85 new RIAs and 57 new investment firms formed, more than doubling April’s combined tally (54 RIAs, 12 investment firms). RIAs grew 57% month-over-month, while investment firms surged 4x, signalling heightened appetite for pooled-capital vehicles. Scale improved at the top end. Five firms launched with assets above $1 billion in May (up from one in April), nudging large-cap entrants to ~3 % of all new registrants. The remaining 137 entities still fell below the $500 million threshold, so small-cap volume continues to dominate in absolute terms. Geographically, New York City remained the busiest market, but Dallas displaced Los Angeles as the second-most active metro—highlighting a fresh growth corridor in Texas alongside the enduring strength of the US financial hub. In this article we’re giving you five that are noteworthy and newly formed RIAs. To view all newly added wealth management RIAs and key contact information, book a demo of Dakota Marketplace here.
