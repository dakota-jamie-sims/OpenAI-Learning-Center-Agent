    "introduction": "In any field, starting something new can be daunting. If you’re here, you no doubt know the level of uncertainty that comes with the process of creating an investment strategy. At Dakota, we’ve been in the field for nearly fifteen years, and have worked across platforms to raise over $35 billion in that time. We know our fair share about getting investment strategies off the ground. In this video, we’ll outline five things that all emerging managers should know as they start establishing themselves and their strategies to go to market. We’ll cover everything from the definition of a true “emerging manager” to the must-have marketing materials so that you have an idea of the whole picture as you get started. You’ll come away with a step-by-step plan of attack, so that you’ll be as successful as possible, as quickly as possible.",
