    "title": "The Top 10 RIAs in London",
    "introduction": "If you're in investment sales, you likely already know that one of the biggest problems of selling to the RIA  channel is the sheer size of it. The RIA market across the United States consists of over 36,000 firms, which means that while there are more than enough to choose from when looking for new clients, narrowing down the list to only those that allocate to outside managers is going to be key. Here at Dakota, we’ve raised over $6 billion from over 350 RIAs, and that has been possible because we qualify and curate our list to only RIAs that allocate to outside managers. In an effort to help narrow down the sheer size of the market, we’ve put together a list of the top 10 RIAs in each major metro area across the country. To determine our list, we looked for three things: An AUM above $200 million A dedicated analyst team An RIA that actively allocates capital to outside investment management firms In this article, we're highlighting the top 10 RIAs in London from our curated institutional investor database, Dakota Marketplace. However, this is by no means a “best of” list, as there are so many high quality RIAs in London. By the end of the article, you'll have a clear idea of the landscape and who you can be calling on. 1. Bedrock AUM: $10,000,000,000 About: Bedrock is driven by their belief in the significant positive impact that wealth holders and wealth managers can have on the world; whether that is from aligning investments to matters at the heart of their clients’ interests to how we support our team members in engaging with SRI & CSR matters. At the core of the business is the requirement to manage clients’ wealth in a way that accounts for their personal preferences, interests, needs and objectives; this calls for the firm to engage in a progressive transition towards sustainable responsible investing (SRI) and not for a radical ‘one-size-fits-all’ approach. 2. London & Capital AUM: $5,540,000,000 About: London & Capital was founded in 1986, and in the thirty years since then, they have kept and nurtured a pioneering and entrepreneurial spirit, working in partnership with clients, many of whom have been with the firm since its inception in 1986. Their clients entrust L&C to manage more than $5.54 billion of discretionary assets on their behalf, and the firm growing all the time as investors from all over the world recognize the value of our collaborative approach. 3.
