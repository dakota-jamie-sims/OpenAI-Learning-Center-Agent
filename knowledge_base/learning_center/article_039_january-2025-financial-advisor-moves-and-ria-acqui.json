    "title": "January 2025 Financial Advisor Moves and RIA Acquisitions",
    "introduction": "The new year got off to a strong start in January, continuing last quarter’s momentum, especially when it came to RIA M&A deals, while private equity investment activity in the space picked up and independent advisors continued to move at a brisk pace. On the M&A front, Dakota tracked a record 43 deal announcements representing approximately $338.3B in client assets, eclipsing October’s then-record 37 deal announcements involving $255B in managed assets. The month’s tally could be a little misleading though, as Mariner’s acquisition of Cardinal Point accounted for $292B – or 86% – of the total. It was a busy month for Mariner, which also acquired three other firms – Cassady Schiller Wealth , Jenkins Wealth , and Triton Financial Group – that added a further $1.1B to its AUA. Outside of Mariner, Corient Private Wealth would have had the largest deal of January with its acquisition of $10.4B New York-based multifamily office Geller MFO , following closely on its December acquisition of $7.9B RIA H.M. Payson , which was the largest M&A deal that month. Among the other more notable deals in the month, Midwest RIAs Vision Financial Group , Business & Financial Strategies , and Clevenger Financial merged to form Financial Integrators , pooling together $2B in client assets, while private equity-backed Homrich Berg finalized its acquisition of $6B WMS Partners, which was announced in December (and not included in this month’s deal announcement totals). RIA investments also ticked higher in January, with Dakota tracking seven deal announcements: Z2 , Hamilton Lane , and Everside Capital investing in Long Island RIA Coastline Wealth Constellation Wealth buying a stake in $3B NoVa RIA Bogart Wealth Elevation Point staking $750M Michigan RIA Stonebrook Private FJM acquiring a 20% stake in $4.7B Atlanta UHNW RIA Balentine OneDigital staking $5B Canadian wealth manager PWL Capital Wealth Partners and Aspire Holdings investing in $2B NY RIA Wealth Alliance Summit Financial and Merchant Investment Management partnering on an investment in $700M Missouri RIA Genex Consulting That heightened pace could be set to continue, as Los Angeles-based RIAs Lido Advisors and Evoke Advisors , as well as Commonwealth Financial Network and Audax Group , are all reportedly in the market shopping minority equity stakes to further their growth. Consulting powerhouse McKinsey & Co. is also reportedly considering a spin off or sale of its $23B in-house RIA MIO Partners . In terms of independent advisor moves, LPL led the way in volume, recruiting seven teams managing a combined $4.1B in client assets, most notably $1.3B New Jersey-based Bruen Wealth Management from UBS and $1B RIA Salient Wealth of California from Osaic. Meanwhile, Dynasty Financial made some of the more notable moves in the month, landing $6.4B SageSpring Wealth Partners from Raymond James and a $1.6B team in Washington, DC, from Goldman Sachs . Other noteworthy developments in January included the launch of new RIAs Wolf Pine Capital in Portsmouth, NH, Bridge Generations Wealth Management in Miami and Salt Lake City, and K2 Wealth Management in Chicago. Pegula family-backed Bison Holdings combined its wealth management and advisory divisions to establish Bison Wealth , Orange County Bancorp launched Orange Wealth Management , and the Pepin family of Tampa launched the Pepin Family Office .
