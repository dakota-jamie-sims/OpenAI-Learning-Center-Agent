There are plenty of resources for you to do just that, everything from publications to weekly calls that enable you to keep your finger on the pulse of new searches, RFPs, and job changes within the industry. At Dakota, it’s our goal to help our peers and colleagues do just that. We’ve raised over $40 billion since 2006, and while it wasn’t always easy, we made it one of our core values to always be uncovering “the new.” This means our sales team is always doing everything they can to stay updated on things like searches.
