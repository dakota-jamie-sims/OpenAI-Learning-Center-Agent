    "title": "Top RIAs on the East Coast of Florida",
    "introduction": "One of the biggest problems when selling to the RIA (Registered Investment Adviser) marketplace is the sheer size of the channel. The RIA marketplace across the United States consists of over 36,000 firms, which means that while there are plenty to choose from when looking for new clients, shrinking the list down to only those that allocate to outside managers is key. For example, here at Dakota, where we’ve raised over $6 billion from over 350 RIAs, and we qualify and curate our list to only RIAs that allocate to outside managers (which are the firms we sell for). In an effort to help narrow down the sheer size of the market, we’ve put together a list of the top 6 RIAs in each major metro area across the country. To determine our list, we looked for three things: An AUM above $200 million A dedicated analyst team An RIA that actively allocates capital to outside investment management firms We have qualified all of the RIAs on this list so that they meet our criteria. We actively call on these RIAs, and all of them can be found within our institutional investor database, Dakota Marketplace. However, this is by no means a “best of” list, as there are so many high quality RIAs in West Palm Beach and around the country. We just wanted to give you a place to start. West Palm Beach 1.
