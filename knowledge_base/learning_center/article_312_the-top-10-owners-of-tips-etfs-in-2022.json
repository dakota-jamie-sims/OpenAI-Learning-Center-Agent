    "title": "The Top 10 Owners of TIPS ETFs in 2022",
    "introduction": "Since the beginning of quantitative easing by global central banks, one of the major goals was to get reflation/inflation of wages, goods, and services across the economy. In order to be protected from the expected inflation to come, many allocators had added inflation exposure via TIPS and other similar inflation vehicles, and have done so since 2008, only to see asset price inflation, but not underlying inflation occur. As a result, many allocators and central banks were left scratching their heads: there was so much liquidity, but no inflation for over a decade. Enter a global pandemic, and bam, we’ve since found that inflation. Now, global supply chain disruptions, combined with the “great resignation” and other pandemic factors impacting employment, we’re seeing the inflation that central banks so desperately wanted. This inflation means that investors quickly needed to gain exposure to rising inflation/CPI in their portfolios. One of the most direct ways is by allocating to TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities). TIPS are linked to CPI, which adjusts and compensates bond holders for that inflation, and they are the most direct inflation hedge, as TIPS’ principal is linked to the CPI-U (Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers). In this article, we’re outlining the top 10 owners of TIPS ETFs. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear understanding of the landscape. 1.
