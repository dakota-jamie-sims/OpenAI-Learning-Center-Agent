You might be wondering if you have what it takes to be successful yourself. At Dakota, we've been in the investment sales field since 2006, and our team has raised over $35 billion in that time. We've honed our process over the years to ensure success, and we've made it our practice to share those tips with other new comers, emerging managers, and peers. In this article, we're sharing what we've found to be the characteristics of a truly elite investment salesperson.
