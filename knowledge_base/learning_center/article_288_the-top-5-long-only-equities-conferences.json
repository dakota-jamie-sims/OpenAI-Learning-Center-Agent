    "introduction": "As an investment sales professional, you must attend conferences to meet with various advisors, consultants, and allocators to increase your touch points for raising capital. It can be a pain to research and keep track of the conferences that the many investment firms have. However, we both know it’s a non negotiable. At Dakota, our sales teams are constantly traveling, city scheduling, and making the most of every trip, whether it’s for a meeting or a conference. Then, what was once a shared calendar of upcoming events became a new feature in Dakota Marketplace called Dakota Conferences. This new feature allows not just our own sales team but all of our customers to see, at a glance, which conferences are happening and when, and what asset class they’re focused on. In this article, we’re outlining five upcoming conferences that focus on long-only equities. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear picture of upcoming events, when and where they’re being held, and if they’re a fit for your firm. 1. 6th Annual Private Wealth East Fall Forum About the conference: The agenda is developed through extensive travel and feedback from the institutional investor community including executive directors, chief investment officers, senior finance and investment staff, general counsels and trustees across superannuation funds, endowments, foundations, insurance companies, healthcare plans, and investment consultants.

Catalyst Cap Intro: L/S Equity | Quant Investing (New York City) About the conference: This Catalyst Cap Intro Event is a highly focused selected strategies event. The event is investor driven and transactional in scope, hosting investment managers and institutional grade investors that are introduced to each other with a view to become investment partners. This summer 2023 Catalyst Cap Intro Event focuses on L/S Equity and Quantitative investing strategies. Strategies covered include: Systematic equity, Fundamental & Research, Emerging Markets, Value/Growth, High frequency trading, Market neutral, Stat arb, Vol arb, Pure Arb, A.I. models, Intangible assets trading, Overlay strategies, CTAs, Options and futures, Currencies, Crypto & Blockchain and more. Managers typically offer their products through investment funds, but also SMAs or advisory features. The event will discuss, among other topics, the immense volatility in commodity sectors such as oil & gas, wheat, metals, and the implications for investors. For investors the challenge continues to be a multi-narrative market, with lingering Covid effects, immense inflation pressures, and the Ukraine war dislocating markets. The event is live, in-person, where managers give presentations during lunch, followed by private meetings. The event concludes with a networking reception. Participants are given access to a dedicated online Catalyst Event Portal, where the agenda, meetings schedule with contact info, participants list and other info are available. The event is exclusive with only around 30 participants in a controlled environment, with a 1:2 manager to investor ratio. The introductions are arranged prior the events, in an investor driven fashion based on the merits of each investment manager and the requests made by the investors. There are no service providers, only managers and investors. Investors are pre-screened and pre-qualified prior the events, by completing a COIN (Catalyst Online Investor Network) questionnaire. Investors constitute predominantly single and multi-family offices, allocator intermediaries, and end-investors, located in the US but also internationally.
