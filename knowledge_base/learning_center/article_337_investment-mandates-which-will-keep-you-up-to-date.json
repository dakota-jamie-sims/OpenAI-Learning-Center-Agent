    "introduction": "Picture this: you learn about a new institutional investment search within your asset class. It looks like a great fit, but it’s already been posted for long enough that you’re scrambling to get everything you need together in time to submit. If this sounds like something you’ve experienced before, you already know how frustrating it can be. That’s why it’s critical to stay as updated as possible on new investment mandates as they happen. In this article, we're going to outline three of the resources that can be used to ensure you never miss another investment mandate. We're including our own product, Dakota Searches as an option, too, but don't worry, we're not here to tell you that our solution is the only one.
