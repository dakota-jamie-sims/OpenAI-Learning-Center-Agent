    "title": "April 2023 Financial Advisor and RIA Moves and Acquisitions",
    "introduction": "Regional banking news continued to occupy the headlines through March and continued to be a deciding factor for FA’s as evaluated what firms they wanted to partner with. In the wires Morgan Stanley and UBS continued to experience large recruiting wins as teams from First Republic departed and sought firms with banking capabilities. On the RIA/independent side, Cresset and Rockefeller have been the strongest in attracting Teams this year. That said, LPL was very active in April and could pull ahead should this momentum continue. In the midst of all of the mergers and acquisitions we have seen over the past two years, we are seeing more comments via financials earnings calls on focusing on organic growth and marketing efforts, essentially getting back to the basics. The same has been said on the RIA side with many business brokers stating that RIAs should not forget about their core business of managing and growing their client base, and not manage themselves to be acquired at a premium. Due to the amount of movement during April, we have separated this month’s update into two segments.
