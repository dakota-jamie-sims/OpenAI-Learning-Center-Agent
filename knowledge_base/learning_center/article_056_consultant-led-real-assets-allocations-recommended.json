    "introduction": "Institutional investors have maintained a strong focus on private infrastructure and real assets, with consultants playing a pivotal role in shaping these strategies. Across U.S. public pensions and retirement systems, notable commitments have been made to a variety of funds, reflecting the sector's appeal for long-term growth, income stability, and inflation protection. Leading consultants such as RVK, Meketa, and Aksia have directed significant capital toward infrastructure investments in energy, renewables, and transportation, among other areas. For instance, RVK facilitated over $1.2 billion in allocations, including $1.1 billion from the New York State Common Retirement Fund to funds like Copenhagen Infrastructure V and Stonepeak Infrastructure Fund V. Similarly, Meketa guided $1.1 billion in commitments, with the California Public Employees' Retirement Systems dedicating $500 million to Macquarie Infrastructure Partners V. These examples underscore the strategic emphasis on infrastructure as a cornerstone for institutional portfolios. In this article, we highlight the largest public pension commitments to real assets and infrastructure investments, showcasing the critical role consultants play in identifying and executing these opportunities. By the end, you’ll gain insights into which consultants are steering the largest allocations in this growing sector. 1.
