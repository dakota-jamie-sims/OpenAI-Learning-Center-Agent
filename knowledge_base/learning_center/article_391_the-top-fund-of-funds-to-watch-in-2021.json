    "introduction": "We know that one one of the biggest challenges faced by alternative investment sales professionals within the fund of fund channel is knowing the underlying fund’s area of focus, and who to call on.  As fund of funds differentiate themselves based on their skill of identifying, evaluating, and monitoring managers, they often have a large number of specialized analysts with an often global footprint. Fund of funds are often able to invest early, move quicker, and allocate larger amounts than many other allocators and should be a key area of focus for every alternative strategy across its lifecycle. At Dakota, we’ve been raising capital within the fund of funds channel since 2006, and have raised over $30 billion dollars over the last fourteen years. In that time we’ve also established Dakota Marketplace, a database of accounts and contacts built by fundraisers for fundraisers. Marketplace is a compilation of fourteen years of research, and finding the right people to call on for our business. We think it can help you, too, and it helped inform this list. To help you narrow down the size of the channel, we’ve put together a list of ten of the larger fund of fund platforms that focus on private equity strategies, hedge fund strategies, or both. By the end of this post, you should have a better idea of the channel, as well as who might be the right people for you and your team to call on.
