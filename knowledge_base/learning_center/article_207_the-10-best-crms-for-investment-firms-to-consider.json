    "introduction": "CRMs are the lifeline to any investment firm. From data integrity to better client service, they can transform the way you do business every day, adding time back into your day and making meetings more productive. However, CRMs are only as good as the information within. Which is why, at Dakota, we’re strong believers in the power of accurate data. A CRM solves a lot of data problems, but only really works if it’s well organized, accurate, and updated regularly. With the focus of strong data in mind, we’ve compiled a list of the 10 best, high-quality CRM options for 2024. While some of these options focus on certain asset classes like long-only, private equity, private real estate, or hedge funds, others are more general and can help you take your data to the next level by pulling in additional data sources. It all depends on what you want your CRM to do. In this article we’re reviewing the 10 best CRM platforms on the market for 2024 and what they have to offer.

Which of these CRMs is right for you? You’ve reached the end of a pretty long list, so you might be wondering: what’s next? When it comes down to it, a CRM is only as good as the data within it. So, the question becomes, which kind of CRM will best allow your firm to manage your data? If you’re an investment firm, you might have more budget available, and tons of data to manage. You also have things like compliance and time to worry about, and want the best, most reliable option for your sales team. If you’re an investment firm looking to fundraise with a customizable and scalable CRM across all channels, Salesforce is best for your needs. If you’re looking for a smaller scale CRM that isn’t as large as Salesforce and still looking to fundraise across institutional channels, SatuitCRM, Backstop, or DealCloud are your best options. If you’re an investment sales professional working with alternative investments, Altvia, Dynamo, or Juniper Square are best for you. If you are working directly with private capital deal making, Affinity is the CRM you’re looking for. If you’re a smaller business that isn’t necessarily in the investment space, or you’re looking for a more general CRM, Hubspot or Microsoft Dynamics are your best options. Lastly, if you’re an investment sales professional looking for a solution that feels more like a shared database, you may need something that’s a little more than a typical CRM. Dakota Marketplace is Dakota’s answer to the countless hours spent cleaning up and managing data. It’s a shared source of accounts and contacts, housed in a database that is built by fundraiser, for fundraisers.
