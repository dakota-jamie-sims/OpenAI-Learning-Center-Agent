    "introduction": "The M&A floodgates opened in October, with Dakota tracking 37 outright acquisitions – by all accounts a record monthly haul – involving over $255B in client assets, along with a handful of minority-stake transactions by strategic investors. Leading the way in deal volume, Beacon Pointe, Cerity Partners, and Waverly Advisors each bagged three acquisitions, while LPL’s acquisition of $100B Atria Wealth Solutions was both the largest deal of the month but also the year, with it absorbing approximately 2,400 new advisors into its growing platform. Meanwhile, Pathstone scored the second-largest RIA deal of the month with its acquisition of ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) advisory Hall Capital Partners, integrating approximately $45B in assets to its now $260B in combined AUA and AUM. On the investment side, one of the more interesting RIA deals in October involved Charles Schwab, BlackRock, and JP Morgan making minority investments in Dynasty Financial Partners to fuel its continued growth. Homrich Berg was busy as well, with TPG taking a stake in the Atlanta-based RIA to join existing investor New Mountain Capital to support future growth, which in October came in the form of snagging a $4B team from Truist to establish a new UHNW office in Tampa, FL. Movement by independent advisors also remained strong in the month, led by LPL Financial with eight additions representing $4.9B in total incorporated assets, followed by seven recruitments by Raymond James representing $4.6B in assets. Finally, other noteworthy developments in the month included Hightower Advisors taking a controlling stake in investment consultant and OCIO solutions provider NEPC and alternative investments technology platform CAIS forming an RIA unit to assist financial advisors in alternatives portfolio construction. Read on for a full roundup of the month’s RIA Deals and Advisor Moves covered by Dakota: RIA Deals TPG Takes Minority Stakes in Creative Planning, Homrich Berg (Oct. 1) TPG made strategic minority investments in both Creative Planning, with over $375B in assets under management, and Homrich Berg, with over $18B in assets under management.
