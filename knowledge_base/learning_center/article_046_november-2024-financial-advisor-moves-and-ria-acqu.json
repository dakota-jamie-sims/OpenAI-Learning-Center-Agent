    "title": "November 2024 Financial Advisor Moves and RIA Acquisitions",
    "introduction": "Last month’s M&A activity in the RIA space proved hard to beat, after October broke records not only for transaction volume – 37 by Dakota’s count, surpassing the previous high of 31 deals in January 2021 – but also by magnitude, following the closing of LPL Financial’s acquisition of $100B Atria Wealth Partners. In contrast, November was a quieter month, with Dakota tracking 17 announced M&A deals involving approximately $25.6B in client assets. That’s just 10% of the $255B in client AUM acquired in RIA deals in October, inclusive of the LPL-Atria completion. Still, there were some notable deals in the month, with Focus Financial’s The Colony Group integrating $6.1B in AUM from its merger with sister company GYL Financial Synergies and CAPTRUST’s acquisition of $5B RIA Boston Financial Management. Another big deal could be in the offing as well, with $9B Los Angeles RIA Churchill Management Group reportedly on the market. On the RIA investments side, November was also quieter than October, with just three confirmed US minority stake deals, though again, another notable deal could materialize in the near future, with $4.8B RIA Kingsview Partners reportedly tapping Republic Capital Group to assist it with the sale of a minority stake. Serial investor Merchant Investment Management reportedly took a stake in a $1.8B FiNet shop of Wells Fargo’s, though with Wells now apparently requiring pre-approval for outside investment in FiNet practices, it will be interesting to see what effect that has on the volume of similar deals in the future. Merchant also scored a cross-border investment during the month, reportedly staking $713M Canadian advisor SPM Financial. Meanwhile, November saw an uptick in independent advisor moves, with Dakota tracking approximately 59 moves by individual advisors or advisor teams, up from around 43 in October. LPL led recruitment activity for the third month in a row with it or its affiliated advisors adding eight teams representing over $2B in collective client assets. Raymond James again closely followed in terms of recruitment frequency, with six new additions representing $2.76B in combined client assets. In terms of client assets recruited, Bank of America stood out by nabbing a $7B private advisor duo from Citi Private Bank, though perhaps most notable in the month was Prudential Advisors completing the integration of its retail broker-dealer and RIA services with LPL. First announced in August 2023, the tie-up represents 2,800 advisors and $60B in client assets that are now part of the LPL network. Other noteworthy developments include the launch of two new RIAs: Indivisible Partners by former Merrill Lynch wealth management head John Thiel, and THECE Wealth Management by former Corient Capital Partners co-founder Jon Tenney. Mercer Capital and Allworth Financial did deals to expand the tax services side of their business, and there were a host of advisor-recruitment-related people moves in the month as well. Read on for a full roundup of the month’s RIA Deals, Advisor Moves, and Other News covered by Dakota: RIA Deals Stifel to Buy Portion of B. Riley Wealth Management Biz for up to $35M B. Riley Financial will sell part of its wealth management business to Stifel for $27M to $35M, with 40 to 50 advisors managing $3.5B to $4.5B in assets transitioning to Stifel in early 2025.
