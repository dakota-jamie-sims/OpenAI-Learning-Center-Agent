    "title": "September 2024 Financial Advisor Moves and RIA Acquisitions",
    "introduction": "September 2024 saw ongoing themes of targeted advisor recruitment and strategic firm acquisitions driven by platform technology and infrastructure efficiencies, access to high-net-worth client networks, and a desire to move into attractive metro markets or expand on existing footprints. On the deal front, private-equity-backed RIAs continued to rack up acquisitions, with Sanctuary Wealth’s pickup of Connecticut’s $2.2B Centel Wealth Advisory the largest in September, while the trio of Wealth Enhancement Group, EP Wealth Advisors, and Kingswood US all acquired firms managing in excess of $1B in assets. Advisor mobility remained high as well, with LPL Financial adding the most teams in September – seven, managing over $3B in assets – while Wells Fargo Advisors added the most assets under management, recruiting four teams managing nearly $4.2B. RBC Wealth Management was not far behind, bringing in two teams managing $3.6B. Meanwhile, Rockefeller Global Family Office recruited the leader of a Morgan Stanley wealth team managing $3.6B, though it’s unclear how many client assets will end up moving with him. In this article, we're reporting the transactions we saw so you are in the know. By the end of this, you'll have a better understanding of the shifts this past September. Read on for a full roundup of the month’s RIA Deals and Advisor Moves covered by Dakota below.
