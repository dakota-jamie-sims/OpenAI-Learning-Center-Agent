    "title": "March 2025 RIA & M&A Activity",
    "introduction": "March saw a welcome bounce-back in deal volume and AUM changing hands after a down February, though one blockbuster deal may have papered over the cracks a bit. Dakota tracked 28 RIA M&A-related deal announcements during the month, well up from 16 the prior month, with at least $302.1B in AUM moving in those deals versus just $32.6B in February. However, LPL 's blockbuster acquisition of $285B Commonwealth Financial Network for $2.7B in cash made up the bulk of the month's AUM tally. Also worth noting, none of these numbers include the $7B in AUM LPL acquired from Bedminster, NJ-based The Investment Center , which closed in March but was announced back in September 2024. In fact, the next largest deal announcement in the month was Wealth Enhancement 's purchase of $3B, Cleveland-based RIA Marcum Wealth . So while March did represent something of a recovery from a down February, it still ultimately paled in comparison to the 43 deal announcements representing approximately $340B in AUM in January, which itself followed a record-setting fourth quarter. On the RIA investment side, March was even quieter than February, with Dakota tracking just four confirmed growth investments, compared to five in the month prior. A brief winter of RIA deal discontent could come up flowers in the end though, with some big M&A deals potentially in the offing -- perhaps most notably more rumblings around $10B Los Angeles RIA Churchill Management , with Focus Financial rumored to be among the possible buyers -- and Blackstone reportedly considering getting into the RIA investing via its Tactical Opportunities strategy, which is also rumored to be gearing up for a $10B Fund V fundraise.
