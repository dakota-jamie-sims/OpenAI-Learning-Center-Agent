    "introduction": "At Dakota, we’ve been raising capital since 2006, and have raised over $30 billion dollars over the last fourteen years. In that time we’ve also established Dakota Marketplace, a database of accounts and contacts built by fundraisers for fundraisers. Marketplace is a compilation of fourteen years of research, and finding the right people to call on for our business. We think it can help you, too, and it helped inform this list. In this article, we’re sharing Dakota’s list of top North American Alternative Consultant firms to call on, and while the list is by no means exhaustive (or in every instance the largest allocator), it is a great starting point for anyone marketing an alternative strategy.
