    "introduction": "It’s never easy launching a new strategy at a new firm, especially when approaching potential allocators. It can be overwhelming knowing who to call, doing the outreach, and following up. This is why we wanted to provide some insights on the Public Pension channel that can be a great resource to help launch your strategy. Pensions have increasingly grown their allocations over the years, and not only help younger firms and managers, but it is really in hope to find future managers they can trust for a long time to come. So, with that being said, it’s important to have the “road map” on how to navigate these larger pensions with Emerging Manager programs that can be daunting at first glance. In this case, we would like to provide you the “road map” to the two largest pensions in New York: New York City Comptroller’s Office and New York State Common Fund. Every pension defines an Emerging Manager differently, even within their own program by asset class. So in this article, you will find the following: How is their Emerging Manager Program organized? Is my strategy a fit based off of Firm AUM or Fund AUM, vintage, etc? Who are the consultants that cover my respective asset class (if any)? Although your strategy might seem like a fit at first glance, it can be a long, grueling process to eventually get the winning ticket. The Due Diligence process can be time consuming and intense, but establishing that relationship and persistence is key. By the end of this article, you'll have a clear understanding of the New York public pension Emerging Manager programs, as well as their requirements. New York City Comptroller Office The NYC Comptroller Office manages five different pensions for the city (Teacher Retirement System, Employees Retirement System, Police, Fire, and Board of Education), so we are laying out the consultants for each asset class per pension because the boards pick different consultants for different asset classes. Also, each asset class defines emerging manager differently, so this is a good example of not all Emerging Manager programs are created equal. Public Markets: TRS - Rocaton NYCERS - Callan POLICE - Wilshire FIRE - New England Pension Consultant BERS - Segal Marco Criteria: Managers are generally limited to under $2 billion of firm-wide assets under management at time of initial funding. Private Equity: TRS - Hamilton Lane NYCERS - StepStone POLICE - StepStone FIRE - StepStone BERS - N/A Criteria: Primarily Funds I – III, raising up to $1 billion with a broad institutional investor base. Buyout, growth equity, and distressed/special situations investment strategies. Firms with institutional-quality middle and back offices and strong operational controls. Real Estate: TRS - Courtland (StepStone) NYCERS - Courtland (StepStone) POLICE - Townsend FIRE - Townsend BERS - Courtland (StepStone) Criteria: Firms with less than $2 billion in total assets under management. Currently raising first, second, or third institutional real estate fund. Currently targeting fund size of $500 million or less. Opportunistic Fixed Income: TRS - Rocaton NYCERS - Callan POLICE - Wilshire FIRE - New England Pension BERS - Segal Marco This sleeve is looking at long-biased, alternative credit investment strategies such as direct lending, special situations, distressed, commercial real estate debt and structured credit. Criteria: Firms that are currently fundraising between $500 million and $2 billion. Have a broad institutional investor base. Employ complementary strategies to the existing portfolio. Hedge Funds: Not as large as the other programs but still important to note. TRS - N/A NYCERS - N/A POLICE - Aksia FIRE - Aksia BERS - N/A Criteria: Firms with less than $1 billion in assets under management and/or less than a 3-year track record at time of funding. Discretionary and systematic macro, commodities, credit, long/short equity, event driven, tactical trading, relative value strategies and focus on low net exposure funds. New York State Common Fund The pension defines emerging managers by stages of their life cycle as a firm, and there is different coverage depending on that stage that we wanted to lay out for you and your firm. It’s also worth noting that in addition to their Emerging Manager program, they also have a Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprise Program that manages over $20B. The criteria here is pretty much firms that are majority owned by women or minority managers that have established a trackable track record, and have their operations sound. This has been a huge emphasis for New York, and will be moving forward.
