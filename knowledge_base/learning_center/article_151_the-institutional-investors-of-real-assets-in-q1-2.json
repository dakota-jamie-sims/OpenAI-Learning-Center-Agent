    "title": "The Institutional Investors of Real Assets in Q1 2024",
    "introduction": "In the first quarter of 2024, institutional investors demonstrated a notable increase in their commitment to real assets, with 47 investments amassing a total of $5.64 billion. This represents significant growth compared to the first quarter of 2023, where 41 investments were made, totaling $4.7 billion. This year's elevated interest centered on infrastructure, commodities, and natural resources, signaling a shift away from traditional assets toward those offering potential inflation protection and portfolio diversification amid global economic uncertainties. This blog also provides a detailed list of institutional investors who have made significant commitments to real assets in the first quarter of the year.
