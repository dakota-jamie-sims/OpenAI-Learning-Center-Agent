    "title": "The Top RIAs in the Top 5 Metro Areas for 2023",
    "introduction": "If you're in investment sales, you likely already know that one of the biggest problems of selling to the RIA channel is the sheer size of it. The RIA market across the United States consists of over 36,000 firms, which means that while there are more than enough to choose from when looking for new clients, narrowing down the list to only those that allocate to outside managers is going to be key. Here at Dakota, we’ve raised over $6 billion from over 2,000 RIAs, and that has been possible because we qualify and curate our list to only RIAs that allocate to outside managers. In an effort to help narrow down the sheer size of the market, we’ve put together a list of the top RIAs in the top 5 metro areas across the country. To determine our list, we looked for three things: An AUM above $200 million A dedicated analyst team An RIA that actively allocates capital to outside investment management firms In this article, we're highlighting the top 5 RIAs in the top metro areas across the United States from our curated institutional investor database, Dakota Marketplace. However, this is by no means a “best of” list, as there are so many high quality RIAs across the country. By the end of the article, you'll have a clear idea of the landscape and who you can be calling on. 1.
