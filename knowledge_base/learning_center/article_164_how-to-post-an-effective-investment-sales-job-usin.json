    "introduction": "Have you ever posted a job for your firm, only to have it take much, much longer than expected to fill the role? Have you hired someone who didn’t meet your firm’s expectations, or left in a perilously short amount of time? If any of these sound like you, you’re not alone. Finding the right candidates in the investment management industry can be a long, arduous task. A lot of the time, no one knows where to turn to find experienced candidates to add to their team. LinkedIn, Indeed, and Job Blast | FundFire all offer a large pool of candidates, but they often don’t align with the specific needs of an investment firm, or there are so many potential candidates that it takes far too long to parse through them all. Raising capital is tough, not to mention for an investment firm finding the right people to focus on the right channels for a specific strategy is not always easy. Throw in market volatility, and in some cases a lack of money in motion, investment firms get frustrated and can be quick to pull the trigger on sales people. This leads to the need for ease of finding job opportunities or openings. At Dakota, we’ve been in the investment sales industry since 2006, and we’ve found some incredible talent along the way.
