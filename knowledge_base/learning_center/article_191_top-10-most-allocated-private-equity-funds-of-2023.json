    "introduction": "In 2023, Dakota tracked approximately 650 investments in private equity totaling nearly $60 billion in allocations. Through our Dakota Marketplace database, we have tracked public investments and other activity from public pension funds, endowments, foundations, and other investment allocators. Private equity activity declined in 2023 from its peak during the pandemic due to factors such as inflation, elevated interest rates, and increased capital costs. The private equity market has been adjusting to a new normal, characterized by the aftermath of the pandemic and economic fluctuations. Despite the slowdown in activity, funds continue to see investors flock to the asset class. In this article, we are covering the top 10 most allocated private equity funds by funding amount that we tracked for the year.
