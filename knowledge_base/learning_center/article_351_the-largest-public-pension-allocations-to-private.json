    "introduction": "Understanding where public pension funds are investing can be a huge piece of an investment salesperson’s day. However, we know that it can also be a very time consuming undertaking, given the sheer number of pension funds across the country. At Dakota, we’ve been fundraising since 2006, and have raised over $40B for our partners in that time. We’ve made it part of our DNA to stay on top of public pension fund investments, and we want to help make these updates as accessible to our peers as possible. In this article, we’re going to break down the largest public pension allocations to Private Equity by General Consultants in 2021. By the end of this list, you’ll have a great starting point to better understand which consultants are making the largest allocations. 1.
