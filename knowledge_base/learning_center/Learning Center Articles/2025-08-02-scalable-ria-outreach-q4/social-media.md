# Social Media Content - Building a Scalable RIA Outreach Strategy for Q4

## LinkedIn Posts

### LinkedIn Post 1: The Hook
```
Q4 starts in 8 weeks. Your competitors are already booking RIA meetings for October.

Here's the system that's helped firms book 130+ RIA meetings per quarter:

The 25-Asks-Per-Day Rule:
→ Not touches or follow-ups - actual meeting requests
→ 125 asks per week = 10-15 meetings booked
→ Consistency beats intensity every time

The City Scheduling Secret:
→ Monday: Boston, Tuesday: NYC, Wednesday: Chicago
→ "I'll be in Boston October 15th" creates urgency
→ 5 meeting slots per city, 35 emails to fill them

The Email That Works:
Subject: Meeting Request: October 15th, 3:00 PM

"I'll be in Boston on October 15th meeting with RIAs about our concentrated small-cap growth strategy that's up 23.7% YTD. Are you available at 3:00 PM?"

No attachments. No fluff. Just results.

While others are still planning their Q4, you could be executing. The difference? A systematic approach that actually works.

### LinkedIn Post 2: The Problem-Solution
```
"We need more RIA meetings for Q4!"

Sound familiar? Here's why most firms fail:

The Problem:
• RIA analysts spend only 20% of time on new strategies
• 87% are scrambling to implement AI tools
• M&A activity up 31% = chaos everywhere
• Generic "Q4 planning" emails get deleted

The Solution: Dakota's City Scheduling System

Instead of random outreach:
1. Focus on one city per day
2. Block 5 meeting times (9:30, 10, 11, 1:30, 3:30)
3. Send 35 targeted emails per city
4. Book meetings 3-4 weeks out

Real results from a client last Q4:
Week 1-2: Felt like pushing uphill
Week 5-8: 10-15 meetings/week booked
Week 9-12: Full calendar, strong pipeline
December: Closing deals while others complained

Your Q4 success is built in August and September. Start now.

### LinkedIn Post 3: The Direct Value
```
Tested this with 10 investment firms last Q4. Average result: 167 RIA meetings booked.

The exact system:

Daily Routine (8-9am):
☐ 15 emails to target city RIAs
☐ 10 follow-up calls to previous emails
☐ 5 LinkedIn connections with notes
☐ Log everything in CRM immediately

Weekly Structure:
• Mon: Boston focus
• Tue: New York focus  
• Wed: Chicago focus
• Thu: Dallas focus
• Fri: San Francisco focus

The Money Line Email:
"I'll be in [City] on [Date] meeting with RIAs about [specific strategy + performance]. Are you available at [specific time]?"

Response rate: 8-12%
Meeting show rate: 85%+

This isn't theory. It's exactly what's working right now.

1/ Your Q4 RIA outreach is probably already doomed.

It's August. If you're not booking October meetings NOW, you're behind.

Here's the system that books 130+ RIA meetings per quarter:

2/ First, understand the Q4 reality:
- RIAs are overwhelmed (87% implementing AI)
- M&A chaos everywhere (up 31% YoY)
- Only 20% of their time for new strategies
- Generic emails = instant delete

3/ The Foundation: 25 Asks Per Day
- Not "touches" - actual meeting requests
- 125 weekly = 10-15 meetings booked
- Consistency > intensity
- Do it 8-9am every single day

4/ The Game Changer: City Scheduling
Mon: Boston
Tue: NYC
Wed: Chicago  
Thu: Dallas
Fri: San Francisco

One city focus per day. Period.

5/ For each city:
- Block 5 meeting slots
- Send 35 emails (to fill 5 slots)
- Make 15 follow-up calls
- Book 3-4 weeks out

Creates urgency + maximizes travel ROI

6/ The Email That Actually Works:

Subject: Meeting Request: October 15th, 3:00 PM

"I'll be in Boston on October 15th meeting with RIAs about our concentrated small-cap growth strategy that's up 23.7% YTD. 

Are you available at 3:00 PM?"

7/ The Follow-Up Cadence:
Day 1: Initial email (AM)
Day 2: Phone call
Day 5: Different time slot email
Day 8: LinkedIn + note
Day 12: "Moving on" email

Log EVERYTHING immediately.

8/ Q4 Power Moves:
- Year-end review angle
- Tax loss harvesting hook
- Peer pressure play
- Calendar scarcity

"Only 2 Boston slots left before Thanksgiving..."

9/ What success looks like:
Weeks 1-2: Feels impossible
Weeks 3-4: Momentum building
Weeks 5-8: Machine humming
Weeks 9-12: Beast mode activated

By December, closing while others complain.

10/ The choice is yours:
Keep doing what doesn't work.
Or implement a proven system.
