        "question": "What is a scalable RIA outreach strategy?",
        "answer": "A scalable RIA outreach strategy is a systematic approach to connecting with Registered Investment Advisors using consistent daily activities (25 asks per day), city-based scheduling, and proven messaging templates to generate 10-15 qualified meetings per week."
      },
      {
        "question": "How many RIA meetings should I target for Q4?",
        "answer": "Using Dakota's 25-asks-per-day system with an 8-12% response rate, you should target 130-195 meetings for Q4, which translates to 10-15 meetings booked per week throughout the quarter."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the best email template for RIA outreach?",
        "answer": "The most effective RIA email is brief and specific: Subject line with meeting date/time, one sentence about your strategy and performance, and a direct ask for a specific meeting time. No attachments or lengthy explanations."
      },
      {
        "question": "How does city scheduling improve RIA outreach?",
        "answer": "City scheduling focuses your outreach on one city per day, allowing you to book 5 meetings in a single location. This creates urgency ('I'll be in Boston on October 15th'), maximizes travel ROI, and demonstrates professionalism that RIAs respect."
      },
      {
        "question": "What technology do I need for scalable RIA outreach?",
        "answer": "Essential technology includes a CRM for tracking all interactions, email automation tools like SalesLoft or Outreach for templates and sequences, calendar integration for time-blocking, and intelligence platforms like Dakota Marketplace for identifying active RIAs by city."
