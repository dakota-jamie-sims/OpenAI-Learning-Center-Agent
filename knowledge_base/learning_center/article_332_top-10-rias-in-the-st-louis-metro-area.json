    "title": "Top 10 RIAs in the St. Louis Metro Area",
    "introduction": "If you're in investment sales, you likely already know that one of the biggest problems of selling to the RIA (Registered Investment Adviser) marketplace is the sheer size of it. The RIA market across the United States consists of over 36,000 firms, which means that while there are plenty to choose from when looking for new clients, narrowing down the list to only those that allocate to outside managers is going to be key. Here at Dakota, we’ve raised over $6 billion from over 350 RIAs, and that has been possible because we qualify and curate our list to only RIAs that allocate to outside managers. In an effort to help narrow down the sheer size of the market, we’ve put together a list of the top 10 RIAs in each major metro area across the country. To determine our list, we looked for three things: An AUM above $200 million A dedicated analyst team An RIA that actively allocates capital to outside investment management firms We have qualified 25 RIAs with AUMs ranging from $20B to $83M in St. Louis that meet our criteria. Below are the top 10 RIAs in St. Louis from that list. However, this is by no means a “best of” list, as there are so many high quality RIAs in St. Louis and around the country.
