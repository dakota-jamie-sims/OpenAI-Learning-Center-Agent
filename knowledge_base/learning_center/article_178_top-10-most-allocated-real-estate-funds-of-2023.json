    "introduction": "In 2023, Dakota tracked approximately 216 investments in private real estate strategies totaling nearly $20 billion in allocations. Through our Dakota Marketplace database, we have tracked public investments and other activity from public pension funds, endowments, foundations, and other investment allocators. In 2023, institutional investors significantly increased their allocations to private real estate, seeking diversification and stable yields amidst volatile financial markets. The trend was driven by a search for inflation hedges and the pursuit of higher returns compared to traditional bonds, with a strong focus on sustainable and tech-enabled properties.
