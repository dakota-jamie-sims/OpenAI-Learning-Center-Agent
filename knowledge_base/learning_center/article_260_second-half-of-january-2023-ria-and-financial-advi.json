    "title": "Second Half of January 2023 RIA and Financial Advisor Moves and Acquisitions",
    "introduction": "The New Year hangover continued into the second half of January as FA movement remained below the higher pace we saw this time last year. There are a few factors why: Higher borrowing costs have slowed outright acquisitions for firms with smaller balance sheets or are not backed by private equity financing. With many transition bonuses were calculated off of trailing 12-month fees/commissions in the broker /dealer world, a majority of FAs are looking at trailing 12 numbers which are lower than a year ago, prompting them to take a “wait and see” approach. Historically, immediately after a volatile year clients are not as open to a change in their firm, but this tends to normalize as the new year progresses especially among BDs. RIA acquisitions were very active during the period among the acquirers we are used to seeing with Cerity and First Republic Bank with some large additions worth noting. Independents: Matt B. Irwin who manages $160 M AUM in Dallas, TX has joined LPL. He is joining the dually registered RIA/ BD platform and was previously with Ameriprise. David J.
