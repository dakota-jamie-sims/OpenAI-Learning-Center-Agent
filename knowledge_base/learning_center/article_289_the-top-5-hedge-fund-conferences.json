    "title": "The Top 5 Hedge Fund Conferences",
    "introduction": "Balancing your firm’s travel budget and the sheer number of investment industry conferences that are held every year — not to mention every month — can be a challenge. How do you make sure you’re attending the right events, with the right people, at the right time? More than that, how can you be sure you know about all of the upcoming conferences? It can feel like a full time job just keeping track of all of these events. At Dakota, our sales teams are constantly traveling, city scheduling, and making the most of every trip, whether it’s for a meeting or a conference. Then, what was once a shared calendar of upcoming events became a new feature in Dakota Marketplace called Dakota Conferences. This new feature allows not just our own sales team but all of our customers to see, at a glance, which conferences are happening and when, and what asset class they’re focused on. In this article, we’re outlining five upcoming conferences that focus on hedge funds. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear picture of upcoming events, when and where they’re being held, and if they’re a fit for your firm. 1. AAAIM National Conference About the conference: AAAIM’s annual conference is the national platform for Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) investment managers across the major asset classes of private equity, hedge funds, public equities, fixed income and real assets to meet, conduct business and learn from insightful leaders - and each other.
