    "title": "The Top 10 RIAs in Stamford",
    "introduction": "If you're in investment sales, you likely already know that one of the biggest problems of selling to the RIA  channel is the sheer size of it. The RIA market across the United States consists of over 36,000 firms, which means that while there are more than enough to choose from when looking for new clients, narrowing down the list to only those that allocate to outside managers is going to be key. Here at Dakota, we’ve raised over $6 billion from over 350 RIAs, and that has been possible because we qualify and curate our list to only RIAs that allocate to outside managers. In an effort to help narrow down the sheer size of the market, we’ve put together a list of the top 10 RIAs in each major metro area across the country. To determine our list, we looked for three things: An AUM above $200 million A dedicated analyst team An RIA that actively allocates capital to outside investment management firms In this article, we're highlighting the top 10 RIAs in Stamford, Connecticut from our curated institutional investor database, Dakota Marketplace. However, this is by no means a “best of” list, as there are so many high quality RIAs in Stamford. By the end of the article, you'll have a clear idea of the landscape and who you can be calling on. 1.

Coastal Bridge Advisors AUM:$2,374,786,806 About: Coastal Bridge Advisors begins almost every relationship by listening to clients, hearing about what they want to achieve, what might keep them awake at night when they think about wealth and finances, and how they'd like to enjoy your life while working and in retirement. Once they've collaborated with the client to identify goals, their team goes into action to help make sure they reach them.
