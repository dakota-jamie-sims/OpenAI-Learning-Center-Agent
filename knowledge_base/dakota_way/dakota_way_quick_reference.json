      "principle": "These four principles all fall under one umbrella concept: Focus on What Matters Most. This core value is the north star of our firm and underlies everything we do.

The four core principles form a circle that when applied just keeps repeating itself.",

Don’t think of this process as a straightjacket meant to replace your individuality with a rigid one-size-fits-all solution. Think of these four foundational principles as rocks and pebbles in a jar, around which you pour the sand of your personal touch and experiences that make the methodology uniquely yours. Rather than limiting you, implementing The Dakota Way into your daily routines will leverage your natural strengths with proven strategies.",

      "principle": "This experience, I’ve come to realize, shares profound parallels with the principles of The Dakota Way. Much like the coaching philosophy I employed at Haverford, The Dakota Way establishes a program—a process that sales professionals can rely on, one that is about more than just the end results. Fundraising is a consultative sale, an educational process—not a closing style of sales like ABC (Always Be Closing). Like coaching, it’s about building a culture where continuous learning, resilience, and a commitment to excellence are valued above all else. It involves creating a supportive environment where sales professionals are encouraged to focus on the things that matter most, for example, booking meetings with the appropriate end buyers, practicing their pitches for the real meeting, and ingraining the use of a CRM into their practices.",
