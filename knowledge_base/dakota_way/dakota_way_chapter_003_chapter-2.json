      "Principle 1—Set Expectations",
      "Back in 2013, Dakota was hired by one of the best investment firms in the world to market a new mutual fund they had recently launched. We were late to interview for the opportunity, so when we got hired, we didn’t know much about the product inside the mutual fund or any historical fundraising data about this asset class.",
      "About a quarter into the engagement, our contact at the investment firm called. “How is the fundraising going?” he asked me. “And why don’t you have more opportunities in the pipeline?”",
      "I started to explain where we were, but realized I needed data to back up my assertions.",
      "First, I asked for a meeting with the big boss, and then I went to work researching this particular asset class. In short, this is one of the oldest asset classes in the mutual fund industry with mutual funds dating back forty years.",
      "With mutual funds, all the data is public, so doing an analysis was very easy. My goal was to figure out where the majority of the assets were located and the length of their track record—meaning how long each of the largest funds had been in the market. I learned that 98.5 percent of all assets were in mutual funds that had a ten-plus-year track record, which translates to “It will take a very long time to grow this mutual fund, far beyond your patience level or projections.”",
      "When I presented this conclusion to the big boss, she looked at me and asked, “Then why did we launch this fund?”",
      "Since we were here late to the game, I said, “I have no idea. I don’t think anyone researched the asset class. This will be a very long haul with little chance of success.”",
      "Unfortunately, this is a common scenario. Many investment strategies are launched without any research on similar past funds, and no conversation takes place between the sales team and the executive team to determine What Success Looks Like. The meeting starts, and the boss says something like, “We have to raise a billion dollars!” when that’s never been done for a firm of their size and based upon their investment strategy. Maybe $200 million would be a home run.",
      "The truth is, there will always be a gulf between what the boss believes is a realistic fundraising goal and what is reality. If a sales plan is not created and agreed upon, there will always be a difference between what the boss (portfolio manager, CIO, CEO) believes is success and what the salesperson delivers.",
      "That’s why you, the salesperson, need to embrace this first principle and Set Expectations.",
      "Sitting down to set expectations with your boss transcends the simple act of sharing information; it is fundamentally about crafting a unified sales plan to create transparency. This ultimately leads to an agreement on What Success Looks Like.",
      "The larger the investment firm, the more likely you’ll have structure around performance expectations and mandated sales plans. As you move toward the boutiques or the one-person sales teams, not so much. At these smaller companies, salespeople such as yourself often need to take initiative to give yourself structure and achievement metrics. Without structure—that is, without agreement or alignment on What Success Looks Like—the Problem of Eighteen Months rears its ugly head. If you’re winging it or following the Read My Mind method, you’re probably not going to be around too long.",
      "Don’t underestimate the importance of this principle. It’s easy to overlook the simplicity of setting expectations and agreeing on what “good” looks like, but it needs to be the starting place. How do you know how to succeed at your job if you don’t know what your boss expects of you? You have nothing to compare your actions to.",
      "Even if you are a one-person sales team, you can put processes in place to protect you from yourself—processes that force you to create a plan and report against it. In this chapter, we’ll discuss how.",
      "What Success Looks Like",
      "There are certain things in the investment business that will never change. One of them is the fact that there’s a big difference between the expectations of a PM/CEO/CIO regarding fundraising possibilities and what is actually realistic for a salesperson.",
      "So how do you solve this difference? It requires a harmonized approach to agreeing on What Success Looks Like.",
      "When I began documenting The Dakota Way, I had a conversation with Andrew O’Shea, a long-time partner and investment sales professional at Dakota. I mentioned the three ideas I had come up with, and he said, “Gui, don’t forget the most important pillar.”",
      "I asked him, “Am I missing something?”",
      "He said, “We have been doing this a long time, raising capital for multiple firms, and setting expectations on What Success Looks Like is the key factor in a successful relationship.”",
      "He was absolutely right. Setting proper expectations around things like the number of daily/weekly calls, number of sent emails, number of meetings set up, and how activity against accounts will be tracked is the key to a successful relationship with your boss, or in our case, our fundraising partners. This not only creates alignment and clarifies a forward path, but it also transforms your sales plan from a mere aggregation of to-dos into a uniformed transparent plan of action. Everyone is on the same page regarding what needs to be done, how to do it, and by when, which makes it much easier to track on-target performance or underperformance.",
      "At Dakota, we say that setting expectations means you’re the dog, not the tail—you’re taking charge and controlling the relationship instead of following along. If you find yourself as the tail, you will likely find yourself no longer with this company.",
      "Here’s another way to look at it: if you don’t set proper expectations, you are like a rudderless ship. You may end up where you need to be, but you don’t have the control you need to get there as quickly and efficiently as possible.",
      "So how do you set clear expectations upfront? By creating a simple one-page sales plan.",
      "Crafting the Sales Plan: A Blueprint for Success",
      "In short, a sales plan is a narrative backed up by facts that explain exactly what you plan to do. For example, if you plan to reach out to all registered investment advisors (RIAs) and family offices, you would create a narrative that explains exactly how you’ll engage with these interested channels on a daily and weekly basis. The sales plan should have as much detail as possible in terms of daily outreach, profiling these channels, and managing your pipeline. Based upon your asset class, it is also helpful to include the amount that other firms and funds like yours have recently raised, giving some reality to the plan.",
      "The final piece to the puzzle is to include the day and time each week or every other week that you will report against the plan. This is key: if you come to an agreement on What Success Looks Like and are reporting your progress regularly against the plan, you keep yourself honest and keep your boss completely in the loop the entire way. No surprises. The worst situation you can put yourself in is having your higher ups or partners thinking you aren’t doing anything.",
      "At Dakota we have a daily check-in at 8:00 a.m. for our sales team to report on their plan and exactly what they are doing. Some may think this is a little crazy, but we have found that this daily accountability generates such a strong foundation that you cannot physically deviate from the plan even if you tried. This intense structure forces each salesperson to state how they performed yesterday against their plan and their plan for the day ahead. Ultimately, it leads to transparency between them and their boss.",
      "Ready to create your own plan? First, think about the following questions:",
      "What are the primary and secondary target channels that will be interested in my product structure?",
      "How will I take action daily to penetrate these targeted accounts?",
      "How will I track my activity against these accounts to provide updates to my boss and portfolio manager?",
      "How often will I review my progress against the sales plan with my boss and portfolio manager?",
      "What is a realistic timeline to raise money for this product?",
      "Next, think about the metrics you’ll include, for example:",
      "Activity metrics: number of daily/weekly calls, emails, and meetings set up",
      "Pipeline metrics: number of accounts in each stage of the sales cycle",
      "Market penetration: percentage of your TAM (RIAs, broker-dealers, etc.)",
      "Sales cycle metrics: average time to move an account from initial contract to closing (make sure to compare this to industry benchmarks, which you’ll find through asset class studies)",
      "Performance tracking: weekly performance against your sales plan",
      "Scorecard metrics: track status of key accounts and next steps",
      "Then bring it all together into a one-page document with clearly defined sections. Here’s how a sales plan for the ABC Large-Cap Growth Fund might look:",
      "Strategy Name and Product Structure:",
      "Strategy Name: ABC Large-Cap Growth Fund",
      "Product Structure: Open-end mutual fund focused on large-cap growth equities.",
      "Target Channels: The focus will be on RIAs as the primary channel, with secondary channels including broker dealers, wirehouses, and institutional consultants.",
      "Primary Channel: RIAs and multifamily offices (Top 300).",
      "Secondary Channels: Bank/broker dealer platforms (seventy accounts), wirehouses (Morgan Stanley, UBS, Merrill Lynch), and institutional consulting groups like Graystone.",
      "Plan of Attack: The sales team will reach out to each account within the TAM to profile their interest in large-cap growth strategies. This will involve:",
      "Daily Outreach: Calls, emails, and meetings scheduled for target accounts",
      "Profiling: Capturing feedback and gauging interest in the strategy",
      "Pipeline Management: Tracking each account in Salesforce, ensuring progress is captured at every stage",
      "The team will aim to enter a sales cycle with the RIA channel within two years and the platform distributors (banks, broker dealers, wirehouses) within one year.",
      "Tracking and Reporting: Progress will be tracked through regular reporting, including:",
      "Activity Reports: Tracking calls, meetings, and follow-ups",
      "Penetration Reports: Showing market coverage across the RIAs, broker-dealers, and wirehouses",
      "Pipeline Reports: Organized by the sales cycle, showing where prospects are in the process",
      "Scorecards: Monitoring the current status and next steps for each key account",
      "The account manager will oversee this process, ensuring consistency and accountability.",
      "Optional: Asset Class Study: To add further context to the sales plan, an asset class study will be conducted. This will analyze how long it has historically taken for similar funds to raise capital, providing a realistic timeline for success. For example, previous studies might show that large-cap growth strategies typically take twelve to eighteen months to gain initial traction with RIAs, while institutional buyers may take longer.",
      "Reporting Schedule: The team will report progress every Monday morning during weekly check-ins. These meetings will focus on:",
      "Performance against the plan.",
      "What was achieved last week.",
      "Plans for the current week.",
      "This level of transparency ensures that everyone stays aligned on the sales plan, progress is continuously monitored, and there are no surprises.",
      "A sales plan like this creates a roadmap that outlines the steps you’ll take to achieve success. It answers critical questions, like “Which channels will you focus on? How many accounts will you target? What actions will you take daily to move those prospects down the funnel? And most importantly, how will you measure and report progress?”",
      "The sales plan is not just a tool for organization; it’s a protection. It keeps you from being caught off guard when leadership asks for updates. Instead of scrambling for answers, you’ll have data-backed reports and a clear record of what’s been accomplished and what’s next in the pipeline. It keeps you honest, keeps your boss in the loop, and ensures there are no surprises.",
      "Ultimately, a solid sales plan ensures alignment between you and your leadership, providing a shared definition of What Success Looks Like. It turns vague expectations into concrete actions and measurable results, giving you the structure needed to stay on track and manage expectations effectively.",
      "Be the Dog, Not the Tail",
      "At Dakota, we have weekly check-ins with our fundraising partners. Because our salespeople all create detailed sales plans and report on them daily, our partners have little room to critique us because we can consistently show progress against the plan. As a result, we have enjoyed career longevity as a business, and so have our individual salespeople. Everyone is aligned. Everyone agrees on What Success Looks Like. And everyone can see that progress is being made.",
      "The primary reason I see salespeople struggle is because everything is too loose or completely opportunistic. There are no clear processes and procedures to follow, allowing them the opportunity to become the tail instead of the dog. By putting the first piece in place, Setting Expectations, everything else naturally follows.",
      "Next we will discuss Principle 2: Know Who to Call On.",
      "Leadership Note on Setting Expectations",
      "From a sales leadership perspective, forcing each individual to write a sales plan and present it in front of the team creates an agreement on What Success Looks Like. This is critical because it transfers the responsibility from the boss to the salesperson and in a natural way makes the salesperson 100 percent accountable for the actions."
