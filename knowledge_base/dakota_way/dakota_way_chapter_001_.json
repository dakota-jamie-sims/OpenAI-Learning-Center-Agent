      "Fundraising is a very difficult job. It requires a fundraiser to commit to a lifetime of “setting up meetings” during which they take a complex story and simplify it so it can be understood and retold.",
      "Which isn’t exactly what anyone went to college for.",
      "So this book is dedicated to my industry colleagues, those hardworking women and men who are grinding away, sending emails, getting rejected, setting up meetings, doing the meetings, and eventually raising capital for their funds.",
      "Here’s to you all! Keep grinding!",
      "Introduction",
      "When my business partner and I started Dakota in 2006, we only had the two of us as salespeople. We continued with that model for the next five years, and then in 2011, we hired our first salesperson, Tim Dolan.",
      "Like many organizations, however, we lacked a sales training program with clearly spelled-out processes, procedures, and expectations. Instead, I trained our first employee with the Read My Mind method—I expected Tim to follow my example and achieve the same results, without any formal guidance from me or anyone else.",
      "Unsurprisingly, my method failed miserably. Tim and the people we hired after him didn’t know what they should be doing. They had no structure or guidelines. The Read My Mind training program resulted in a lot of frustration and a lot of employee turnover.",
      "After burning through numerous salespeople over the next year, I realized I needed to do something. I needed a system of processes and procedures that I could use to train salespeople and they could all follow on their own.",
      "So I did some research and came across a book called Work the System by Sam Carpenter. Sam was running a call center in Portland, Oregon, and was burned out from working too many hours. In response, he decided to document everything he did and then set the company up, through processes and procedures, so it functioned without him having to go into the office.",
      "I decided to follow Sam’s plan. I documented every single thing I did as a salesperson, from the initial outreach, to winning the mandate, and everything in between. I then started teaching that approach to each new hire.",
      "What I learned from Sam Carpenter completely transformed our business. This method has now been codified as The Dakota Way.",
      "The Dakota Way",
      "In investment sales, we have what I call the Problem of Eighteen Months: as fundraisers we have eighteen months to prove ourselves or we’ll be looking for another job. However, without formal sales training, new fundraising hires usually spend the first six months simply figuring out the job, who they should call on, how they should pitch the product, how to follow-up, and so on. By the time they get settled, they only have a year to make something happen—that is, to raise money—and with six- to thirty-six-month sales cycles, that strategy is problematic, to say the least. (Ideally, they need to be building pipelines in the first month, not in month nine or beyond, but I don’t want to get ahead of myself.)",
      "During those first six months spent learning the ropes, they’ve usually produced no sales, and they have an anemic pipeline. In response, senior leadership becomes frustrated and people get fired.",
      "This might be a slight generalization, but it’s not far off and way too sad.",
      "I’ve been there. I’ve faced the challenges of connecting with prospects, of standing out in a ridiculously competitive market, of striving to meet and exceed unrealistic quotas, of living under the threat of changing jobs every eighteen months. During the first seventeen years of my career, I worked for eight different companies. Every eighteen months, I came home and told my wife I was leaving one job and starting another. Thankfully, she was super supportive, but changing so often had a negative impact on my early career. I never stayed in a job long enough to build a commission stream.",
      "My first goal in writing this book is to help you overcome the Problem of Eighteen Months. I want to give you a time-tested, proven framework for effectively raising money as an investment salesperson from your first day on the job. Through this framework, The Dakota Way, you will understand what truly works in this industry: the art of setting expectations, the science of creating a Total Addressable Market (TAM), the fun of becoming a master messenger, and the leverage of a killer follow-up system (a.k.a. using a Customer Relationship Management system [CRM]).",
      "These are the elements that, when combined, lead to better outcomes not just in terms of raising capital, but also in maximizing your efficiency and effectiveness as a sales professional. We’re talking about 10X-ing your time, achieving more with less, and reaching heights you previously thought unattainable.",
      "My second goal is to end the massive amount of turnover that results from the Problem of Eighteen Months. That kind of churn isn’t good for the individual, and it’s not good for the company. It takes a while to build momentum in investment sales, and if you switch jobs every eighteen months, your forward progress keeps getting cut off. You never get the pipeline built or gain the experience, the knowledge of your product isn’t developed to where it should be, and reward in the form of healthy commissions is not received. It’s like pumping water in a well up to 60 or 80 percent, quitting, moving to another well, and starting all over again at zero. A lot of work with nothing to show for it.",
      "I want to help salespeople like you stay long enough to pump water all the way out of the ground and reap the rewards of your labor. If you have the tools from day one, you will more likely pump 100 percent on your first try, stay with the company for the long haul, and enjoy a very lucrative career.",
      "This book lays out a time-tested system for succeeding in investment sales. The Dakota Way is far more than a sales technique; it’s a philosophy and a process, as well as a mindset that has been meticulously codified into four core principles:",
      "Set Expectations",
      "Know Who to Call On",
      "Become a Master Messenger",
      "Have a Killer Follow-Up System",
      "These four principles all fall under one umbrella concept: Focus on What Matters Most. This core value is the north star of our firm and underlies everything we do. When confused or uncertain about something, we simply ask, “What truly matters here more than anything else?” Then we act on that.",
      "These principles aren’t just abstract concepts; they’re the bedrock of our sales course uniquely tailored for investment sales professionals. It’s the only course of its kind, designed by fundraisers, for fundraisers, who aim not just to meet their fundraising goals but to exceed them in ways they never thought possible.",
      "As you turn these pages, you’ll find detailed explanations of each of the four core principles, examples of how they can be applied, and practical exercises to help you integrate them into your own sales business. You’ll learn how to prioritize your actions, focus on what truly matters most, and build a sales process that is not only efficient but also sustainable and scalable. The four core principles form a circle that when applied just keeps repeating itself.",
      "No matter what investment firm you work for, no matter what kind of sales training is (or is not) in place, no matter how many years you’ve been in this industry, following this framework can and will help. Don’t think of this process as a straightjacket meant to replace your individuality with a rigid one-size-fits-all solution. Think of these four foundational principles as rocks and pebbles in a jar, around which you pour the sand of your personal touch and experiences that make the methodology uniquely yours. Rather than limiting you, implementing The Dakota Way into your daily routines will leverage your natural strengths with proven strategies.",
      "I would not use these principles at Dakota or put them here in print if I didn’t truly believe they helped my team play at the highest professional level, achieve results, and stay in their careers for a long period of time.",
      "Altogether, this handbook can guide every step of your career in investment sales, from new fundraising hire to the CEO.",
      "Lessons from the Course",
      "Between 2011 and 2018, around the same time I was formulating and first implementing The Dakota Way, I had the privilege of coaching the Haverford School golf team in Haverford, Pennsylvania. Our achievements include six league titles and two undefeated seasons, which speaks volumes to the power of teamwork and leadership. My tenure as a coach was marked by incredible victories, heartfelt connections with the team and their families, and invaluable lessons in leadership and guidance.",
      "Reflecting on my coaching days, I realize that my role was less about teaching and directing, as a football or lacrosse coach would do. It was more about offering unwavering support and guidance. Since golf is an individual sport, everyone has their own style. I felt my job was to create a culture where each person could play unencumbered by a coach in their head.",
      "From ensuring the team had top-notch gear to organizing memorable events for the team and families, my aim was to create an atmosphere where each player felt supported and understood. I created a structured environment where athletes could thrive by focusing on consistency, goal setting, and continuous improvement—an environment that fostered a mutual respect, allowing me to step back and let the players’ talents shine.",
      "At Haverford, I was tasked with creating a program, not just a team, and that meant encouraging focus and discipline in my athletes, crafting a process for both them and myself that was designed to lay the groundwork for this season and the ones to come.",
      "This experience, I’ve come to realize, shares profound parallels with the principles of The Dakota Way. Much like the coaching philosophy I employed at Haverford, The Dakota Way establishes a program—a process that sales professionals can rely on, one that is about more than just the end results. Fundraising is a consultative sale, an educational process—not a closing style of sales like ABC (Always Be Closing). Like coaching, it’s about building a culture where continuous learning, resilience, and a commitment to excellence are valued above all else. It involves creating a supportive environment where sales professionals are encouraged to focus on the things that matter most, for example, booking meetings with the appropriate end buyers, practicing their pitches for the real meeting, and ingraining the use of a CRM into their practices.",
      "Balancing support with clear expectations was the cornerstone of my role as a coach at Haverford and continues to be my leadership approach at Dakota. It underscores the belief that when individuals feel supported and valued, they are more likely to excel and contribute positively to the organization’s overall success and, of course, their own.",
      "Yelling, demeaning, teasing, throwing people into the deep end with no help, failing to set proper expectations—these may have been common leadership tactics in the past, but they don’t work. They have no place in coaching, leading, or the way we treat our teammates, fellow salespeople, or ourselves. The Dakota Way represents a departure from those old ways of treating people and brings a more humane and vulnerable approach to helping individuals get what they want out of their job and profession.",
      "It was not always this way with my leadership style, as many of the early employees can attest. Through a process of self reflection, my own style has evolved and I’ve shifted my focus to helping others get what they want out of life. I’m still learning and growing.",
      "As a nod to the lessons I learned on the course and at Dakota, I will end each chapter with a leadership note—a way to apply The Dakota Way as a leader. If you’re not currently in a leadership role, that’s okay. These tips will be there when you need them.",
      "Transformation Starts Now",
      "In the dynamic world of investment sales, success is not just about what you sell but how you sell it. The Dakota Way capitalizes on this truth and outlines a processes-driven approach to fundraising that has worked for Dakota since our founding in 2006 and has made many salespeople highly productive. It has been the cornerstone of our company’s strategy, enabling us to raise over $35 billion in our partnerships with over eight investment firms—a testament to a system that’s not just theory but practice, not just ideas but results.",
      "The Dakota Way is not a quick fix or a shortcut, nor is it limited to one skill level. It’s a comprehensive, long-term strategy that requires commitment, discipline, and a willingness to learn and adapt. Any investment sales professional at any point in their career can benefit from applying its principles. Whether you’re a seasoned professional looking to refine your approach or a newcomer eager to make your mark in the world of investment sales, this book is the ultimate resource for you to take your career to the next level and master the art of investment sales.",
      "Sales is not merely a goal but the culmination of numerous right actions, from the initial targeting of a prospect to getting the call that you have won the mandate. It’s a long series of small things that when all stitched together create the results—the magic. The heart of The Dakota Way transcends the conventional wisdom of investment sales in order to create a structure that achieves this magic day in and day out.",
      "We invite you to join us on this journey. Delve into strategies and insights that promise not only to enhance your sales career now but to transform your approach to leadership in the years to come. Embrace the principles, practice the techniques, and start achieving the kind of results you’ve always dreamed of.",
      "Welcome to a journey of discovery, growth, and unparalleled achievement, where the ultimate goal is to elevate the standard of excellence in the fundraising business.",
