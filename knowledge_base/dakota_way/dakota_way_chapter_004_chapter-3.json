      "Principle 2—Know Who to Call On",
      "About fifteen years ago, my colleague Joe and I did a sales call with a professional investor. We started off by explaining what we do: we’re an active, concentrated large-cap growth manager.",
      "“Well, I only invest in passive large-cap growth,” the man said.",
      "“Have you considered active?” Joe asked.",
      "“Yes, but I have chosen to only do passive.”",
      "“Well, can I try and convince you of the merits of being active in large-cap growth?”",
      "“No, I’m not interested in active. I only do passive.”",
      "Joe went back and forth like this for a few minutes, trying to convince the guy to do something he didn’t want to do. It was very unproductive, as you might imagine. In the midst of that conversation it struck me: taking no for an answer was a better route in this case.",
      "After the meeting, I told Joe, “We shouldn’t spend our time convincing people to buy something they really don’t want to buy. Instead, we should zero in on buyers who already buy what we sell.”",
      "This idea has become an essential part of The Dakota Way. While conventional sales wisdom says, “Don’t take no for an answer,” The Dakota Way recommends the opposite strategy: take no for an answer and move on. Don’t be in the convincing business. Instead, find people who want to buy what you sell.",
      "Another core principle at Dakota is we sell apples to apple buyers. Our “apple” is active equity strategies. We shouldn’t waste our time trying to convince orange buyers—those interested in passive strategies—to buy apples. We should find more apple buyers and add these people to our prospect bucket. After all, we aren’t in the convincing business.",
      "That’s really the goal of any investment sales professional: create a bucket and fill it with as many qualified buyers as you can—firms you know invest in your type of investment strategy. Add to that bucket every day. It’s that simple.",
      "In the intricate dance of investment sales, knowing your prospect is as crucial as knowing the steps. Knowing Who to Call On is not just about making sales calls; it’s about making the right sales calls. It’s about understanding the nuances of product structure and channel focus to ensure that your sales efforts are not just diligent but also directed.",
      "Knowing Who to Call On ultimately begins with the identification of your TAM, a critical exercise in understanding who the real buyers are. Clarity on your TAM will enable you to tailor your sales efforts effectively, ensuring that you’re not simply casting a wide net but fishing in the right waters.",
      "In this chapter we’ll define TAM and discuss how to properly reach out.",
      "Product Structure Drives Channel Focus",
      "Your product structure drives your channel focus. In other words, what you sell determines who you call on.",
      "For instance, mutual funds are widely used by RIAs, as well as banks and broker dealers, to create portfolios for their clients. Thus, any fundraiser raising capital for a mutual fund should make sure they get meetings with as many RIAs as possible to explain their investment strategy. At the same time, they should make sure every bank and broker dealer analyst who covers their asset class is familiar with their strategy and is monitoring it. The RIAs have discretion and can make faster decisions, whereas a bank or broker dealer will require a longer due diligence process, but both sales cycles need to move on parallel tracks. The mutual fund product structure drives this multifaceted channel focus on RIAs, banks, and broker dealers.",
      "The mistake many salespeople make is that they call on organizations that do not invest in their particular product structure, as Joe and I did many years ago in that meeting. Someone might really want to call on the endowment at Harvard University, but if their product structure is a mutual fund and that endowment doesn’t invest in mutual funds, calling on Harvard would be a waste of time. Instead, find the best-fit channel that uses your product structure.",
      "To Focus on What Matters Most is to find the organizations that consume your type of product structure and investment strategy. Every day, fill your bucket with qualified buyers—and no one else. Don’t pursue big brands like Harvard and Yale just because they’re big brands. Let your product structure drive your channel focus, and don’t waste time filling your bucket with channels that don’t want your “apples.” Focus your efforts solely on those who want what you sell.",
      "So how do you define the right channel for you? Let’s get into it.",
      "Defining Your Total Addressable Market",
      "You can think of your TAM as the apple buyers in your bucket who are interested in buying your apples. Keep it simple: identify your best-fit channels and focus on getting meetings with those investors.",
      "It’s helpful to get very specific here and identify the number of qualifying accounts in your TAM. For example, if there are three thousand RIAs, you need to know how many of those will actually be interested in your strategy. To help you arrive at this number, you can look at historical allocations and see where each RIA has invested prior and narrow down your TAM to people who buy exactly what you sell.",
      "Understanding your product structure and its fit within the market allows you to define your TAM with precision. This clarity is not just for your benefit but also enables portfolio managers to understand the strategic focus of sales efforts. For example, when questions arise about why funds are not being raised with certain investor segments like endowments, foundations, or public pension funds, a well-defined TAM provides a clear rationale. It highlights the alignment, or lack thereof, between product offerings and potential investors’ preferences.",
      "This specificity becomes even more critical when discussing different types of investment strategies. The conversation shifts dramatically when moving from mutual funds to private equity funds, underscoring the importance of targeting the right investors for your product.",
      "Once you’ve identified your TAM, you know exactly who you’re going to be reaching out to. So how do you execute to make progress against your TAM? City Scheduling.",
      "City Scheduling: A Tactical Approach",
      "One of the most practical applications of Knowing Who to Call On is City Scheduling. This method is about efficiency and focus, reducing an overwhelming list of accounts into manageable segments. Organizing accounts into metro areas takes an insurmountable task and makes it achievable.",
      "For example, let’s say you have determined that the TAM for your product includes RIAs, banks, and broker dealers. Nationwide, that channel totals approximately 2,700 accounts—an overwhelming number at first glance. Break down that total by city, however, and you have something much more manageable. Chicago, for example, might have eighty-five RIA accounts, a number that can realistically be covered in a day or two via individual email outreach.",
      "The City Scheduling approach involves planning meetings in a city three to four weeks in advance, with a structured agenda for each day. Not only does this ensure coverage of key accounts, but it also imposes a discipline that keeps your sales focus on track.",
      "To get started, put a city on your calendar, your notepad, your spreadsheet, or whatever you use to write out your plan. To make the most of the time and get a full day of meetings in, add time slots of 9:00 a.m., 11:00 a.m., 1:00 p.m., 3:00 p.m., and 4:30 p.m. Because you’ve identified your TAM, you can easily segregate the firms to reach out to in Chicago who fit the channel and strategy that you’re selling.",
      "In order to fill those five time slots with meetings, start sending around thirty emails a day three to four weeks in advance. While all of these people won’t answer you, they’re still seeing your email, seeing your name, and seeing your brand—your outreach is still making an impact. Ideally, the meetings you do schedule will take place in person, but if you are only able to get one meeting in a city, you can always convert to Zoom.",
      "The key to success with this approach is to be scheduling five to ten cities at any given time to keep yourself structured and focused. The goal is to maintain a consistent “asking” process to meet with potential clients across your best-fit channels who are targets for what you’re selling.",
      "Now, how do you properly ask for a meeting with your TAM? We’ve found one surefire way to structure your emails.",
      "Crafting the Perfect Email",
      "The art of the email is in its clarity. When reaching out to schedule meetings, the subject line should be direct and compelling. For example, “Meeting Request 1/27, 3:00 p.m.” leaves no room for ambiguity.",
      "The body of the email should be equally succinct, ideally two to three sentences introducing yourself and your firm strategy, with a definitive call to action. This conciseness respects the recipient’s time, and making a specific request increases the likelihood of a positive response.",
      "Here’s an example:",
      "Subject Line: Meeting Request January 4th at 3:00 p.m.",
      "Body:",
      "I will be traveling to Chicago with Susan Wilson, President of Sterling Management, on 1/4 and would like to meet and introduce ourselves.",
      "Sterling manages approximately $30 billion in a 22-stock, high-quality, large-cap growth portfolio with weightings between 2% and 8%, where the highest weighting represents the high discount to present value. The strategy has performed in the top decile of its peer group since 2006 with a team that has been together since that time.",
      "Can you meet at 3:00 p.m. on 1/4?",
      "This email packs a punch while being short and concise. By ending your email with a clear call to action, you give the recipient specificity, and if they cannot meet at 3:00, they may say, “No, but I can meet at 2:00.”",
      "By sending this email to around thirty people a day, you’re likely to book a few meetings. Even if you don’t receive a definitive yes, those people still know who you are and what you do.",
      "Your key to City Scheduling and email sending is consistency. The more people hear your name and your brand, the more likely they will remember you down the line, so your next outreach won’t feel like a cold call.",
      "Drive Purpose Daily",
      "The second core principle of The Dakota Way, Know Who to Call On, sets the stage for a targeted, efficient, and effective sales strategy. It gives you purpose every single day.",
      "Start by understanding your product structure and the channels who are interested in what you sell, and define your TAM as precisely as possible so you know exactly who to call on. Then use City Scheduling and your mastered email to position yourself not just as a salesperson but as a strategic partner to your boss and investment firm.",
      "This chapter lays the groundwork for a sales approach that is focused on the process of identifying and engaging with the right prospects in the right way. Next we will discuss Principle 3, Become a Master Messenger in your meetings with qualified buyers.",
      "Leadership Note on Know Who to Call On",
      "In Principle 2, establishing the TAM and creating the email are relatively easy. What is hard for leaders is holding salespeople accountable for City Scheduling. They feel like they are micromanaging.",
      "Newsflash: this is not the case.",
      "If you care about your salespeople, you need to hold them accountable for always scheduling five cities on the calendar at any given time. This simple act will help them consistently make progress against their sales plan and grow their pipelines. You set them up for success and ensure they don’t get stuck.",
      "Having this expectation is not micromanaging."
