      "Principle 3—Become a Master Messenger",
      "Early in my investment sales career I did a great job with City Scheduling in Cincinnati, so I flew in to pitch our partner’s strategy at the five meetings. I spent two grand on flights, hotels, and a rental car to get me to those meetings—but I didn’t spend enough time preparing for the meetings themselves. Because I had not put in the hard work to take a complicated story (an investment strategy) and make it easy to understand, I did a poor job articulating the strategy. At the end of each meaning, I could tell the person sitting across from me was still confused about what we did, even though I had just spent an hour talking to them about it.",
      "That experience completely changed my relationship with storytelling. It taught me that I needed to master the art.",
      "Investment sales involves long sales cycles, which means you’re never calling on the end buyer. That person will have to pitch the product to a colleague, who will have to pitch it to an investment committee, who will have to pitch it to another decision-maker, and so on. You have to make sure the story is easy to understand and easily repeatable.",
      "After those meetings in Cincinnati, I started distilling the core principles of our investment strategy so I could articulate them quickly and clearly, that way my first contact could repeat the same story just as quickly and clearly, and so could every person down the line.",
      "Then I came up with a visual way of explaining the importance of storytelling to my team so they could do the same. This is what I came up with: Imagine that when you sit down with an initial contact, you have a ball of clay sitting on the table between you. You are a professional sculptor of clay, and the person across from you is a professional buyer of clay sculptures.",
      "Who do you want to do the sculpting? The professional sculptor, of course.",
      "The problem is that most salespeople let the buyer do the sculpting, and when they’re finished, the ball looks like it was hacked up by a five-year-old kid.",
      "If you have practiced your pitch and have complete control over your storytelling, you can carve that clay into the exact sculpture you’re trying to sell, which should be the exact sculpture that person is looking to buy. However, if your message isn’t clear and the potential investor is confused to the point of asking basic questions that should have been answered already, the ball of clay gets hacked up into something that isn’t what you intended or what the buyer wants. The result is frustration for everyone.",
      "You may have narrowed your target market and filled your bucket with buyers who want your product, but if you can’t carve the sculpture so the person sees what you’re selling and how they can benefit from it, your pitch will fail.",
      "This chapter delves into the art of messaging, from the opening minutes to the closing questions. It offers strategies to ensure that your message not only resonates but also makes it easy for your prospect to repeat to their decision-making colleagues.",
      "Master the First Two Minutes",
      "Now that you’ve successfully filled time slots in your chosen city, how do you go about your presentation pitch in each meeting?",
      "The opening moments are critical—they set the tone and direction of the conversation. As a fundraiser, your goal is to center the conversation on the key points of your firm and strategy so the prospect knows what they should be listening for.",
      "This isn’t just an introduction; it’s a strategic overview designed to preempt fundamental questions and establish a solid foundation for the discussion. Key points to cover include:",
      "The firm’s founding",
      "The firm’s location",
      "Assets under management",
      "Number of investment professionals",
      "Strategies managed",
      "Length of track record",
      "A unique value proposition",
      "Client base",
      "Here’s an example of a two-minute opening that covers these points:",
      "Sterling Management was founded in 1998 and today manages approximately $15 billion in one 25-stock large cap growth strategy on behalf of numerous foundations, endowments, corporate and public pension funds, RIAs, banks, broker-dealers, and family offices. Based in New York City, the investment team consists of four portfolio managers and six analysts. The portfolio managers have all worked together at Sterling for twenty-five-plus years. They only manage one strategy, launched in 2010, that can be accessed via a mutual fund and separately managed accounts.",
      "The importance of practicing your opening remarks cannot be overstated. A well-rehearsed introduction ensures that you convey all necessary information quickly and efficiently, allowing more time for in-depth discussion via Q&A. This preparation prevents the meeting from being bogged down by basic inquiries that could have been addressed at the outset.",
      "I vividly remember the hotel in Milwaukee where I stayed during my first fundraising trip after my not-so-successful trip to Cincinnati. This time, I typed out my pitch and practiced it in the mirror, what felt like fifty times, until I had it down. When I was in those meetings, my opening comments flowed. I answered all of the allocators’ questions before they even had a chance to ask.",
      "Mastering the first two minutes requires practice. That’s one of the activities that matters most in investment sales because it enables you to succinctly address these points and transition smoothly into the core of your presentation, focusing on the specific strategy you’re there to discuss.",
      "The Middle Part: A Q&A Conversation",
      "After your opening remarks, you need to get into a conversation. If you feel nervous, it’s easy to launch into a long monologue. Avoid that temptation and instead have a dialogue.",
      "Let the prospect guide you.",
      "I don’t mean let them hack up the ball of clay. I mean let them ask questions and then control the conversation—sculpt the clay into the answer they want to hear. If you haven’t practiced your message and aren’t able to provide that clear, sculpted answer, the prospect will come up with their own interpretations. That’s when you end up with a messy lump.",
      "Remember, every prospect has a method to their madness of investing. Likewise, every investment strategy has a story. Your job as the salesperson is to understand the prospect’s method and explain the investment strategy’s story in a way that the prospect wants to hear it. To aid your understanding, ask questions, and then give short answers to the prospect’s questions. This will promote more questions and keep the conversations going.",
      "In preparation for your meeting with RIAs, or any investor for that matter, research their website for their most recent quarterly newsletter. This will show you their current thinking on investing so you can tailor your questions and comments accordingly. Before going into any meeting, you should know exactly what a professional investor wants to know about your investment strategy.",
      "So tell them what they want to hear!",
      "While this may sound a little brown-nosy, I’m here to tell you it’s not. The job of a professional fundraiser is to (1) very specifically know the most important information a professional buyer wants to hear about their investment strategy and (2) be able to articulate those exact nuggets of information in an easy-to-understand way.",
      "One question you should ask earlier in the conversation is “Could you please walk me through your investment decision-making process?” The answer will give you a good understanding of how both the due diligence analyst and the firm think about making investment decisions.",
      "This is the art of being a Master Messenger. Set up all the meetings you want to, but if you cannot connect with the buyer and tell them what they want to hear in an easily repeatable way, you are dead in the water.",
      "The Art of the Follow-Up",
      "Once the meeting has come to a close, traditional wisdom suggests that follow-up occurs after the meeting via a series of long emails with PDF attachments. However, nothing could be more wrong. The Dakota Way advocates for a more proactive approach.",
      "If you have been in the investment sales business for a while, then you will be all too familiar with following scenario:",
      "The boss asks, “How was the meeting?”",
      "“Great meeting,” the salesperson says.",
      "“Why?” asks the boss.",
      "“Um, um, well, you know, we had a great conversation, they were really into the strategy, and they had some really good buying signals.” (At this point I generally want to puke.)",
      "In order for me to not embarrass my team daily with this gibberish, around 2012, I announced, “As of today, we are banning the phrase ‘great meeting’ at Dakota. If they wired $10 million in the meeting into the mutual fund, then you can say it was a ‘great meeting.’ Otherwise, tell us the current status and next steps.”",
      "At the same time, we implemented a mandatory follow-up technique that does not happen after the meeting but in the meeting.",
      "As any meeting draws to a close, we ask the two toughest questions. The conversation goes like this:",
      "“Susan, I really enjoyed our meeting today. Do you mind if I ask you a few quick questions? We have spent an hour together, and I think you have a good understanding of our strategy.",
      "“Do you see our strategy fitting into your asset allocation model for your clients?” (Question 1)",
      "If the answer is No, then you know what the follow-up is: mailing list.",
      "If the answer is Yes, then you ask Question 2: “If that is the case, do you anticipate conducting a search in our asset class within the next twelve months?”",
      "If the answer is No, you know what the follow-up is: mailing list.",
      "If the answer is Yes, then you ask, “What would be the next steps we could take to begin to better familiarize you and your team with our strategy?”",
      "If you are marketing a private fund that has closing dates, then you would replace Question 2 with “If that is the case, do you think you would be able to make the March 31, 2030, final close?” Your follow-up based on their yes or no answer would be the same as before.",
      "These questions are not mere formalities; they are strategic probes designed to gauge genuine interest and potential next steps and avoid the trap most salespeople find themselves in post-meeting: The Unknown.",
      "As a professional fundraiser, asking these two core questions allows you to level set, saving yourself time and allowing you to focus your efforts on prospects who are genuinely interested in their strategy.",
      "By focusing on clarity, preparation, engagement, and strategic follow-up, you can transform your communication from a mere exchange of information into a powerful tool for building relationships and driving success.",
      "This chapter has laid out the strategies and techniques to help you achieve that transformation. In our fourth and final principle, we will review the need for a Killer Follow-Up System to capture the results of masterfully delivering your message.",
      "Leadership Note on Becoming a Master Messenger",
      "As a sales leader, it is critically important that you hold each salesperson accountable for asking the two toughest questions to close the meeting. You’re actually doing your team a disservice if you don’t do this. You’re also cheating yourself out of the single greatest time-saving process.",
      "If your salespeople ask these two questions, you know exactly where the company stands after each meeting—whether they’ll be moving an opportunity forward or moving on to the next prospect."
