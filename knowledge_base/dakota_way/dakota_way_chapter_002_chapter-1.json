      "The Umbrella—Focus on What Matters Most",
      "In investment sales, the landscape is perpetually shifting, presenting a myriad of challenges and opportunities at every turn. Many variables are subject to external forces far beyond our control as salespeople—market conditions, the performance of specific strategies, lack of return of private equity capital, dominating performance of just seven stocks, and the timing of investment searches are all subject to external forces, to name just a few. We have to figure out how to ignore all this noise.",
      "In The Dakota Way, we rely on one umbrella concept to do this: Focus on What Matters Most.",
      "This overarching idea serves as the bedrock upon which all other strategies and tactics are built, guiding sales professionals through the complexities of their roles with clarity and purpose. It emphasizes the power of focusing on factors that are within our grasp: outreach efforts, the number of meetings secured, the messages conveyed in those meetings, and the manner in which follow-up happens. Each of these elements is a lever that can be pulled to drive progress and achieve results. By focusing on controllable factors, you can ignore the uncertainties and background noise of the market, knowing that you are doing everything within your power to do the things that matter most.",
      "In investment sales, what matters most can be distilled into the four core principles of The Dakota Way:",
      "Set Expectations",
      "Know Who to Call On",
      "Become a Master Messenger",
      "Have a Killer Follow-Up System",
      "We will devote one chapter to each of these principles, but for now, we set the foundation: effectively using your time so that you are focusing on these areas that matter most.",
      "Time: The Invaluable Asset",
      "Time, often referred to as the only asset we truly possess, is an invaluable and irreplaceable resource that dictates the pace and direction of our personal and professional lives. Time’s finite nature underscores the critical importance of managing it with the utmost care and precision, especially in the fast-paced, results-oriented world of sales. Because time flies, we must Focus on What Matters Most, day in and day out.",
      "To make the best use of our time, we must discern the relative value of our daily activities, recognizing that not all tasks are created equal. This discernment allows us to prioritize activities that offer the highest potential return on investment, thereby propelling us forward in our goals, while avoiding those that detract from our progress.",
      "However, the challenge lies in the ability to accurately identify which activities are truly high-impact and which are not. This requires a combination of self-awareness, goal clarity, and the ability to objectively assess your actions: Are they really bringing you closer to your sales goals? Is there a more efficient way to achieve the same outcome?",
      "This is where The Dakota Way can help. It lays out exactly what you should be doing—as frustrating as that might be—and helps you focus on working smarter by leveraging tools and technologies that can automate routine tasks like sending invitations to schedule meetings or using Slack to get the meetings you have scheduled into your CRM. Using CRMs like this frees up more time for activities that require a personal touch—tasks that benefit from your unique skills and expertise like cold emailing or doing face-to-face meetings.",
      "At the end of the day, the ultimate goal for a sales professional is to continuously set up meetings with qualified buyers. Thus, high-impact activities include those that directly contribute to that end, such as identifying your TAM, practicing your pitch, and city scheduling—all of which will be discussed in coming chapters. Any time spent on other activities, like redesigning the pitch deck, redesigning the website, or sending long, multiparagraph emails that no one reads, is time wasted and money lost.",
      "By focusing on these high-value activities, you can ensure that you and your team are using their time where it matters most. Adopting this mindset permits sales professionals to ensure that they are not just busy but productive, making the most of the only true asset at their disposal: time.",
      "No Easy Button",
      "About thirteen years ago, one of the partners of a firm we work with announced, “We really need to redo our presentation deck.”",
      "“I’m good with that,” the CEO said. “But let’s be clear about one thing. We manage money, and with that presentation deck, we’ve raised $10 billion. I don’t think it’s the presentation deck that raised us the money; it’s our performance. That’s what matters most.”",
      "It’s so natural to want to focus on things like the presentation deck, isn’t it? Or rearranging your desk. Or redoing the website. Those things are so much easier to deal with than the constant rejection that comes with sales. I’m sure you get tired of unanswered emails and hearing the word no.",
      "Let me say this in the nicest way possible: there is no easy button in investment sales.",
      "There is no way around cold calling and cold emailing, and the rejection that comes with it. You have to do the hard work. Focusing on things that don’t matter may be a welcome distraction, but it will not make you a successful salesperson.",
      "In any endeavor, there are only a few things that really matter. If you focus on those key principles, everything else will fall into place. If you focus on tasks outside of these principles—like redoing the website or updating the presentation deck—you set yourself up for challenges.",
      "As we delve deeper into the principles of The Dakota Way, you will see that this approach is not merely about selling more effectively; it’s about working smarter, not harder. It’s about recognizing that our time and energy are finite resources that must be wielded with precision and intent.",
      "By focusing on what matters most through setting expectations, knowing who to call on, being a master messenger, and having a killer follow-up system, we set the stage for unparalleled success.",
      "This chapter has laid the foundation for the transformative journey that lies ahead. Let this concept guide your actions, inform your decisions, and inspire your aspirations as you navigate the challenging yet rewarding path of investment sales.",
      "As we explore the four core principles of The Dakota Way, remember that the journey to mastery begins with a single step: the decision to focus on what truly matters.",
      "Now that the foundation has been laid, let’s get into the first principle: Set Expectations."
