      "Principle 4—Have a Killer Follow-Up System",
      "For many salespeople, follow-up involves keeping track of meeting notes jotted down on miscellaneous sticky notes, in Excel spreadsheets, and on yellow pads. If you’ve ever tried this “system,” you probably know how well it works: not well at all.",
      "To achieve explosive success in the high-stakes world of investment sales, or any sales job for that matter, you need a Killer Follow-Up System in the form of a CRM software.",
      "This chapter explores how leveraging a CRM can 10X your productivity, because you will have rapid, one-click access to the information that matters most to you.",
      "The Power of a CRM",
      "At its core, a CRM is more than just a digital Rolodex; it’s a comprehensive tool that enables sales professionals to track meetings they have completed, view call notes, and streamline the sales process.",
      "The transition from 1X to 10X isn’t just about working harder; it’s about working smarter. A CRM is pivotal in achieving this efficiency, providing a structured and accessible platform for managing sales activities.",
      "Using your CRM properly to track your meetings will create sales triggers, allowing you to quickly act on past meetings. Let’s look at four key features of your CRM.",
      "1. Track Meetings Scheduled to Create Sales Triggers",
      "One of the fundamental uses of a CRM is to track your activities—meetings scheduled, calls made, emails sent, and meeting notes taken—over a long period of time, whether it’s sixty days, ninety days, or more. This historical data becomes invaluable over time, allowing you to review past interactions and identify opportunities for follow-up or further engagement. It can also automate those sales triggers and set up reminders, ensuring no opportunity falls through the cracks.",
      "Being able to see, with one click, who you have met with and what action is next is indispensable. As I said before, time flies, and if you do a lot of meetings, the downside is that you have a lot of meeting notes. Having a technology to help manage all that data is what makes someone a 10X versus a 1X to 2X salesperson (1X being average).",
      "2. Utilize Past Activity Reports",
      "Once you’ve tracked your meetings in the CRM, you can run Activity Reports. In case you missed it: these Past Activity Reports are a goldmine of information. They provide a snapshot of your meetings scheduled over a given period of time. By regularly reviewing thirty-day, sixty-day, and ninety-day reports, you can easily identify which prospects need to be followed-up with.",
      "This approach not only ensures that you’re consistently engaging with your prospects, but also helps create sales triggers so you can take action. This makes follow-up a natural and systematic part of your routine, and because you can accomplish it within one-click, you are not wasting time looking for information.",
      "3. Create and Manage Pipeline Reports",
      "Pipeline Reports, commonly called Opportunity Reports, are another very useful tool for tracking your sales progress. As it sounds, Pipeline Reports are reports of opportunities you have created against an account. Generally the report will include columns such as Firm Name, Opportunity Name, AUM (assets under management), Product, Stage, Account Type, Contact Name, Email, and Phone, with custom text boxes Current Status and Next Steps.",
      "The opportunities should be sorted by Stage with the hi ghest in the pipeline at the top—in other words, the one that is closest to being closed should appear first. By reviewing consistently, you’ll be able to move through the list, taking action on those with the most work to be done so the opportunities at the bottom eventually go to the top. Being able to see your opportunities with one click gives you a quick view of the next action steps you need to take without having to think very hard.",
      "If we go back to Setting Expectations, these Pipeline Reports are what you use in your weekly update meetings with your boss. With little effort and not a lot of extra work, you can keep them in the loop.",
      "4. Reducing Time Spent Searching",
      "A significant advantage of a CRM is its ability to save time, a resource as valuable as any in the sales profession as stated in the first chapter. Salespeople often find themselves sifting through notes, emails, and documents, trying to recall details of past interactions or locate contact information. This search is not just frustrating; it’s time-consuming and thus counterproductive.",
      "By centralizing all of your sales information in a CRM, you eliminate the need to search through disparate sources. This efficiency means more time spent engaging with prospects and less time trying to remember who they are or what was discussed last. The Dakota Way advocates for this streamlined approach, emphasizing the importance of accessibility and organization in maximizing sales effectiveness.",
      "Maximize Your Productivity",
      "Because of the one-click recall of past meetings with the call notes attached, a CRM is the number one leverage point a salesperson can use to 10X their productivity. This technology should be the backbone of your sales process. We use Salesforce, but there are many other good CRMs for investment salespeople to use, such as Hubspot, Satuit, DealCloud, Backstop, Altvia, and Affinity.",
      "Having a Killer Follow-Up System is not just about persistence; it’s about precision. By harnessing the capabilities of CRM, sales professionals can transform their follow-up process from a scattered effort into a targeted strategy that maximizes productivity, from tracking activities and creating sales triggers to managing Pipeline Reports and reducing time spent searching for information.",
      "Remember that the principles outlined in The Dakota Way are not just theoretical concepts but practical tools designed to elevate your sales process.",
      "Leadership Note on Having a Killer Follow-Up System",
      "Many leaders struggle with one vexing question related to follow-up: how tough should you be on your salespeople about entering meetings scheduled and meeting notes into a CRM?",
      "The answer: very tough.",
      "Meeting notes are gold bars. The information provides each salesperson with one-click access to their past activities, which triggers sales actions, which is the most important factor in 10X-ing their productivity.",
      "Conclusion",
      "One of my most favorite and spontaneous coaching moments happened during my third to last year of coaching, and during my son’s sophomore year. Our team stood near the scoreboard waiting to see who would win the league championship. When the scores came out, we saw that we lost by one shot—an entire season came down to one shot. To make matters worse, we lost to our archrivals.",
      "In hockey and lacrosse, the custom is to form a handshake line after each game. In golf, the custom is one handshake after a round, but no line. Seeing a coaching moment, however, I called the team over and said, “Line up, boys. We’re forming a line to shake the champions’ hands.”",
      "“No way,” said our captain.",
      "“Please get in line,” I repeated.",
      "I then asked the opposing coach to line up his team, and we walked the line shaking the champions’ hands.",
      "“Worst thing I have ever done,” one player said afterward.",
      "Afterward, I gathered the team by a tree and asked, “Boys, any ideas why I asked you to do that, beyond congratulating them for winning the league title?”",
      "Our captain immediately piped up. “I know why.”",
      "“Why?” I asked.",
      "“Because you don’t want us to ever feel that feeling ever again.”",
      "“Exactly,” I said.",
      "Except for our captain, we were a young team that would be together for the next two years. The year after we lost by one shot, we won the league title with a 27–3 record. The year after that, my last year, we won it again, posting a perfect 35–0 record.",
      "Intent is a powerful thing. Those last two years, the boys played with specific intent on what they wanted to accomplish. While the 35–0 record is quite remarkable, the fact that we set that specific goal ten months before the season started makes it even more remarkable.",
      "The team played with clear intent all season to run the table.",
      "Sales is no different, yet it is the one area of business that leaves so many shades of gray regarding potential behaviors to get the job done. There is no Six Sigma of sales like there is in all other areas of business, which makes it difficult to figure out what scalable sales process to use.",
      "This is exactly why I have written this book: to give you one man’s approach, with the most clear intent possible, on how to run your sales process and reach your fundraising goals.",
      "The Dakota Way and its four core principles are built with clear intent. When followed, they will, in all likelihood, generate positive results for you and your team.",
      "To cut to the chase, investment sales is hard. Having a proven sales process with only the activities that matter most is critical to success.",
      "This is what I have done with The Dakota Way.",
      "The Dakota Way",
      "Umbrella Concept: Focus on What Matters Most. For whatever you are trying to accomplish as a salesperson, there are always one or two actions that will have maximum impact. The following principles outline these priority actions.",
      "Principle 1: Set Expectations. Create a sales plan, get agreement on what good looks like, and regularly schedule time to report progress against the plan.",
      "Principle 2: Know Who to Call On. Identify your TAM, create the right email with a clear call to action, and implement City Scheduling.",
      "Principle 3: Become a Master Messenger. Open the meeting with a two-minute overview hitting the key points, move into Q&A on your investment philosophy and process, and end by asking the two tough questions.",
      "Principle 4: Create a Killer Follow-Up System. Pick a CRM, enter all scheduled meetings and call notes, create Activity Reports to create sales triggers, and create Opportunity Pipeline Reports to create additional sales triggers and report progress against your plan.",
      "At the heart of The Dakota Way is the concept of Focus on What Matters Most. This foundational pillar is your guiding light, leading you to prioritize and achieve the most impactful results daily.",
      "Setting expectations is one of things that matters most. When you come to an agreement with your boss about What Success Looks Like, you act like the dog, not the tail. Create the sales plan and set the weekly or biweekly meeting cadence to report progress against your plan.",
      "Identifying your TAM and engaging with your best-fit channels forms the next step in the process, which demands persistence, creativity, and an unwavering commitment to send email meeting requests daily, regardless of what is going on in the markets.",
      "Becoming a master messenger is not an innate talent but a skill honed through practice, practice, and more practice. It’s about refining your pitch, connecting with your due diligence analysts, and conveying the key elements of your strategy with clarity. Don’t forget to follow up in the meeting. Don’t leave the conference room or the Zoom room without the answers to those two tough questions.",
      "The final piece to the puzzle is your Killer Follow-Up System, your CRM, the key leverage point for a salesperson. Getting the meetings scheduled into the CRM for rapid recall to trigger sales actions allows you to 10X your productivity. A CRM is not just about organization; it’s about freeing you to be able to quickly focus on the actions that matter most.",

      "Establish your TAM and all the accounts you think you should be calling on—people who buy what you sell.",
      "Know and practice delivering your story. Know how to carve the sculpture so people see what you’re selling and want to buy it.",
      "Utilize the CRM to",
