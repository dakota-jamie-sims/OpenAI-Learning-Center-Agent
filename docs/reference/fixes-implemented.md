# Fixes Implemented

## Summary
All critical issues have been fixed. The codebase is now ready to use GPT-5 models with the responses API.

## Changes Made:

### 1. Updated Model References ✅
- Changed all model references from `gpt-4.1` to `gpt-5` variants
- Updated config to use:
  - `gpt-5` for complex tasks (orchestrator, writer, fact checking)
  - `gpt-5-mini` for balanced tasks (KB search, summaries)
  - `gpt-5-nano` for simple tasks (SEO, social media)

### 2. Fixed Output Directory ✅
- Updated config to use `output/articles` instead of non-existent path
- Simple orchestrator now uses config's OUTPUT_BASE_DIR
- Ensures consistent output location across all pipelines

### 3. Created Missing Directories ✅
- Created `src/prompts/` directory
- Created `src/services/` with `__init__.py`

### 4. Implemented Responses API Support ✅
- Created `src/services/openai_responses_client.py` - wrapper for responses API
- Created `src/pipeline/gpt5_orchestrator.py` - new orchestrator using responses API
- Created `scripts/generate_gpt5_article.py` - script to use new orchestrator
- Added `auto_gpt5` alias for easy execution

### 5. Environment Setup ✅
- API key already configured in `.env`
- Vector store IDs available for knowledge base search

## Usage:

### Traditional approach (Chat Completions API):
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python scripts/generate_complete_article.py --topic "your topic"
```

### New GPT-5 approach (Responses API):
```bash
source ./activate_context.sh
auto_gpt5 --topic "your topic"
# or directly:
python scripts/generate_gpt5_article.py --topic "your topic"
```

## Key Benefits of Responses API:
- Better reasoning with chain-of-thought support
- Lower latency with reasoning effort control
- Improved tool handling with custom tools
- Verbosity control for optimal output length
- Conversation continuity with previous_response_id

## Next Steps:
1. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
2. Test with a simple topic
3. Monitor token usage and adjust reasoning effort as needed
