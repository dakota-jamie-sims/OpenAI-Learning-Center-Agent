# Feature: Comprehensive Fact-Checking System

## Overview
The system implements multi-layer fact verification to ensure 100% accuracy in all generated content.

## Implementation Details

### 1. **Fact Extraction**
Location: `src/tools/fact_verification.py`

The system extracts these fact types:
- Percentages: `73%`, `increased by 15%`
- Currency: `$2.3 billion`, `$500 million`
- Dates: `in 2023`, `since 2020`
- Comparisons: `grew by`, `declined 10%`
- Rankings: `ranked #3`, `top 5`
- Statistics: `1,000 investors`, `500 basis points`

### 2. **Source Credibility Scoring**
```python
credibility_scores = {
    "sec.gov": 10,              # Government
    "federalreserve.gov": 10,   # Central banks
    "bloomberg.com": 8,         # Financial media
    "wsj.com": 8,              # Major outlets
    "cnbc.com": 6,             # General news
    "wikipedia.org": 3,         # Low credibility
    "reddit.com": 2            # Avoid
}
```

### 3. **Verification Process**
```python
# For each fact:
1. Check if citation exists
2. Verify citation is from credible source (6+)
3. Calculate confidence score
4. Flag issues if any

# Overall credibility:
(fact_score * 0.6 + source_score * 0.4) - penalties
```

### 4. **Automatic Rejection**
Articles are REJECTED if:
- Overall credibility < 80%
- Fact accuracy < 90%
- Any facts lack citations
- Too many low-credibility sources

### 5. **Iteration Process**
```python
while not approved and iteration < 3:
    # Get specific fix instructions
    # Iteration Manager fixes issues
    # Re-validate
```

## Integration Points

### Phase 6: Validation
```python
# In chat_orchestrator.py
fact_verification = await self.fact_checker.verify_article(article_content)
if not fact_verification["approved"]:
    return {"approved": False, "issues": [...]}
```

### Fix Instructions
The system provides exact fixes:
- "Replace source for '73%' claim"
- "Add credible source for statistics"
- "Fix broken URL: example.com"

## Output Reports

### 1. **Fact-Check Report** (`fact-check-report.md`)
```markdown
## Summary
- Overall Credibility: 87%
- Fact Accuracy: 93%
- Verified Facts: 45/47

## Source Analysis
- High-credibility sources: 12
- Average credibility: 8.2/10

## Fact Details
[Detailed verification for each fact]
```

### 2. **Quality Report** (`quality-report.md`)
Includes fact-check summary and recommendations

## Configuration
In `src/config_enhanced.py`:
```python
MIN_WORD_COUNT = 2000
MIN_SOURCES = 12
CITATION_STANDARDS = {
    "max_source_age_months": 12,
    "preferred_domains": [...],
    "banned_domains": [...]
}
```

## Testing
```bash
# Run fact-check on existing article
python -c "
from src.tools.fact_verification import EnhancedFactChecker
checker = EnhancedFactChecker()
result = checker.verify_article(open('article.md').read())
print(result)
"
```

## Common Issues
1. **"Facts missing citations"** - Iteration Manager adds them
2. **"Low credibility sources"** - Replaces with better sources
3. **"Broken URLs"** - Currently simulated, production needs real HTTP

## Future Enhancements
- Real-time fact database integration
- Live URL verification
- Historical fact tracking
- Cross-reference checking
