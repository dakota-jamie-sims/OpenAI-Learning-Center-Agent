1/ üßµ Is private equity becoming the new 60/40 for RIAs? 

Our Q1 2025 data shows RIA PE allocations surged 45% YoY - the largest increase on record.

Here's what's driving this seismic shift:

2/ First, the numbers: RIAs committed $4.2B to PE in Q1 2025, up from $2.9B in Q1 2024.

But it's not just about quantity - the TYPE of funds they're choosing reveals the real story.

3/ 72% of RIA commitments went to growth equity funds.

Why? These funds offer:
- Lower volatility than VC
- Clearer path to liquidity
- Proven business models

Perfect fit for RIA risk profiles.

4/ The game-changer: Fund minimums dropped 40% on average.

Many funds now accept $1M commitments (vs. $5M+ previously), opening doors for RIAs with $500M-$2B AUM.

5/ Why does this matter? 

RIAs manage $8.2 trillion in assets. Even a small shift in allocation preferences creates massive fundraising opportunities.

Smart GPs are already adapting.

6/ Meanwhile, family offices zigged where others zagged: 38% of their PE allocation went to sector specialists. üìä

Healthcare and tech funds captured $2.8B from family offices in Q1 alone.

7/ Public pensions? They're all about co-investments.

Co-invest allocations up 230% YoY as pensions seek to reduce fees and increase control. 

If you're not offering co-invest, you're missing out.

8/ The surprise winner: Mid-market buyout funds ($500M-$2B) captured 67% of new commitments.

Mega-funds actually saw allocations DECLINE 18%. 

Investors want nimble, not just big.

9/ Looking ahead: We project $180B will flow to PE in 2025.

The winners will be funds that:
- Cater to RIA needs
- Offer sector expertise
- Provide co-invest opportunities
- Right-size their funds

10/ Want the full breakdown by investor type, strategy, and geography?
