TEST VECTOR STORE INTEGRATION
============================

Run this command to test if your system is properly integrated with the vector store:

cd "/Users/jamiesims/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-jsims@dakota.com/My Drive/learning-center-agent-open-ai"
./venv/bin/python test_vector_store_integration.py

This will:
1. Verify vector store access
2. Show file counts and status
3. Test search functionality with sample queries
4. Check if orchestrators are configured for vector store
5. Confirm integration is working properly
