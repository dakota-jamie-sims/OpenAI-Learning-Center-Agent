FIX FOR VECTOR STORE UPLOAD ERROR
=================================

The error "'Beta' object has no attribute 'vector_stores'" means you need to update the OpenAI library.

Run these commands to fix it:

cd "/Users/jamiesims/Library/CloudStorage/GoogleDrive-jsims@dakota.com/My Drive/learning-center-agent-open-ai"
./venv/bin/python -m pip install --upgrade openai
./venv/bin/python scripts/upload_all_to_vector_store.py

The vector_stores API requires OpenAI SDK version 1.0 or higher.
