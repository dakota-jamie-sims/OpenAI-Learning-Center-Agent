# Private Equity Secondary Market Trends 2025: GP-Led Engines, Pricing Recovery, and What to Do Next

## Key Insights at a Glance
- Secondary transaction volume surpassed $100 billion globally in 2024, with GP-led deals accounting for more than 50% of activity; continuation funds represented the majority of GP-led volume (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).
- Average pricing improved materially versus 2023: discounts narrowed into the low teens on average for diversified LP portfolios, with high-quality GP-led assets clearing close to par in competitive processes (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).
- Dry powder in dedicated secondaries funds is estimated at hundreds of billions of dollars relative to deal flow, supporting pricing resilience and faster deal timelines in 2025 (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).
- NAV growth and reduced denominator-effect pressures are stabilizing seller behavior, shifting the mix from forced LP sales to proactive portfolio shaping and GP-led “hold extension” solutions (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).

GP-led secondaries have decisively moved from niche to center stage. For institutional investors and financial professionals, 2025 looks set to deliver a market in which continuation funds and strip sales drive complex, larger transactions—and where underwriting skills, data advantage, and structuring craft are the differentiators that matter most (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025). At the same time, pricing is recovering as NAVs normalize and exit markets gradually reopen, bringing a more balanced buyer-seller dialogue and better alignment on forward value creation (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).

Below is a practical, data-informed view of what to expect and how to position portfolios and programs for the next leg of growth.

## The Market Reset and 2025 Setup
After two years of dislocation fueled by slower exits and denominator-effect constraints, the secondary market has become the safety valve and growth engine of private equity allocation. Global transaction volume exceeded $100 billion in 2024, aided by a resurgence of GP-led activity and a steady drumbeat of LP portfolio trades to manage liquidity, pacing, and strategy tilts (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025). Buyers’ capital remains abundant, with dedicated secondaries dry powder—plus multi-asset managers increasingly leaning in—helping to compress execution timelines and stabilize clearing prices (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).

NAV dynamics are key. As public markets recovered and GPs adjusted marks to reflect operating performance, average discounts narrowed, notably in diversified LP books where the market shifted from steep teens discounts in 2023 to low-teens or better in 2024 (and tighter for quality, recent-vintage funds) (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025). For GP-leds backed by resilient assets—mission-critical software, healthcare services, infrastructure-like cash flows—dislocations have largely faded, with multiple competitive bids frequently pushing clears to single-digit discounts or par (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).

In 2025, expect a more fluid market where sellers choose timing and structure, rather than being forced by constraints, and where buyers emphasize asset-level diligence and downside protection (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).

## GP-Led Secondaries: The Growth Engine
GP-led secondaries—continuation funds and strip sales—now anchor market growth. Continuation vehicles are solving for “duration mismatch” by backing high-conviction winners beyond the traditional fund life, aligning existing LPs and new capital behind a targeted value-creation plan (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025). Strip sales, which monetize part of a portfolio while retaining upside, are gaining traction where sponsors want to de-risk and fund follow-ons without losing control (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).

Key features shaping 2025:
- Larger deal sizes: Single-asset continuation funds above $1 billion are more common, with multi-asset deals bundling two to five assets to balance concentration and liquidity goals (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).
- Specialist underwriting: Buyers require sector experts and operating playbooks to credibly underwrite three-to-five-year value creation at the asset level, including growth capex, pricing strategies, and M&A pipelines (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).
- Governance upgrades: Independent fairness opinions, robust conflicts protocols, and clear rollover options for existing LPs are standard, with syndication often used to diversify the buyer base and keep speed to close (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).

For GPs, the bar has risen: processes need crisp equity stories, transparent KPI baselines, and documentary readiness at the portfolio company level. For buyers, deal leadership increasingly hinges on bringing solution capital and a record of partnership, not just price (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).

## Pricing Recovery and NAV Dynamics
Pricing is in recovery mode as NAVs stabilize and the outlook for exits modestly improves. Three effects matter:
1) NAV catch-up: With marks now better aligned to public comps and operating performance, the “NAV overhang” that drove wide bid-ask spreads is easing (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).
2) Exit optionality: Although IPOs remain selective, sponsor-to-sponsor and strategic M&A windows have widened, improving underwriting visibility on base and upside cases (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).
3) Competition: More capital is targeting GP-leds, compressing risk premia for high-quality assets; LP portfolio pricing also benefits as buyers seek deployment at scale (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).

Implications for 2025 underwriting:
- Discounts for diversified LP portfolios: low teens on average, with higher-quality, recent-vintage managers in high-demand sectors transacting inside 10% (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).
- GP-led “core growth” assets: par to low-single-digit discounts in competitive processes; more cyclicals or operationally intensive stories still require meaningful concessions (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).
- NAV sensitivity: Buyers continue to model downside NAV revisions, but base cases assume mid-single-digit annual NAV growth for mature portfolios and high single digits for growth assets with identified catalysts (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).

For investment committees, the takeaway is clear: define price-to-risk ratios by asset cohort. Underwrite to three-to-five-year value-creation plans with conservative exit multiple assumptions, then pay for resilience and cash conversion, not just headline IRR potential (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).

## What Buyers Are Paying For
The market premium in 2025 accrues to:
- Concentrated exposure to proven winners: three-to-five assets, each with measurable cash flow durability and clear levers (pricing power, cross-sell, buy-and-build) (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).
- Sectors with structural advantages: vertical software, healthcare services, data infrastructure, and specialty finance platforms with strong underwriting track records (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).
- Governance and alignment: rollover from selling funds, sponsor coinvest, and incentive structures that put the GP and continuation vehicle on the same side of the table (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).

Return targets remain disciplined: buyers generally aim for mid-teens net IRRs and 1.5x–2.0x net multiples, with duration around three-to-five years and underwriting tilted to multiple stability and deleveraging rather than aggressive multiple expansion (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025). Where financing is used, prudent leverage and hedging protect downside, with covenant-light structures giving way to tighter documentation in higher-risk cases (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).

## Liquidity Solutions for LPs: From Triage to Strategy
LPs are moving from defensive selling to strategic portfolio management. Themes in 2025:
- Proactive pruning: LPs sell tail-end funds, non-core managers, or strategy overlaps to streamline monitoring and free capital for priority pipelines (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).
- Vintage rebalancing: Sales of older vintages at tighter discounts, recycling into recent vintage primaries or GP-leds with near-term catalysts (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).
- Scale blocks: Larger, curated portfolio sales to fewer buyers reduce execution risk and earn better pricing through concentration and quality (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).

Execution best practices include clean data rooms, standardized consent templates, and pre-negotiated transfer mechanics. Many LPs now run semi-annual portfolio diagnostics to flag candidates by performance quartile, unfunded profile, and manager outlook, building a cadence for repeatable, lower-friction sales (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).

## Capital Supply and Demand: A Tighter Spread
Dedicated secondaries dry powder continues to grow, supplemented by multi-asset platforms and evergreen pools seeking yield and cash flow visibility (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025). Demand remains robust from:
- Pension plans and insurers for capital-efficient exposure with shorter duration.
- Sovereign wealth funds and OCIOs seeking faster deployment and curated access to brand-name GPs via GP-leds.
- Wealth platforms building semi-liquid solutions that use secondaries to manage liquidity and volatility (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).

Meanwhile, financing markets have normalized, with NAV-based facilities, pref equity, and hybrid solutions used both by buyers and GPs to bridge timing and optimize hold structures (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025). The result: deals fund more reliably, and processes can run compressed timelines when assets are ready.

## Structuring, Terms, and Governance: Getting It Right
The complexity and size of GP-led deals make terms, process, and transparency non-negotiable. 2025 norms include:
- Rigorous conflicts management: independent fairness opinions, clear disclosure of GP economics, and a genuine “status quo” option for existing LPs (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).
- LP-friendly election mechanics: meaningful rollover choices, fee resets aligned with a shorter duration plan, and governance features like independent directors where appropriate (McKinsey Global Private Markets Report, 2025).
