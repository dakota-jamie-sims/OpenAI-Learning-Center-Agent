Post 1 — Market Momentum
Infrastructure isn’t just holding up—it’s accelerating. In 2024, private markets infrastructure deal value rose 18% YoY, marking the second-highest year on record. 🚀 That momentum is shaping Q3 2025 allocations and exit strategies, with resilient valuation markers and healthy fundraising pipelines.

Our latest piece breaks down:
- Where the 2024 deal surge is concentrated 🌍
- Why unlisted infrastructure funds have outperformed many traditional asset classes over time 📈
- How to triangulate manager reports with market-wide signals to assess pacing and liquidity through Q3 2025 🔎

We also flag a gap: no specific, confirmed dataset labeled “Infrastructure Performance Q3 2025” was found in the Dakota Knowledge Base—so we lean on multi-source evidence and scenario testing to guide decisions.

If you’re calibrating deployment, hedging rates, or planning exits in the next two quarters, this analysis is for you. ➡️ [Link]
