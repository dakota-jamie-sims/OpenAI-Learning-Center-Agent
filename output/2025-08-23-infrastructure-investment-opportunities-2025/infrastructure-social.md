Post 1 (strategy + urgency)
The 2025 infrastructure race has started fast: January alone saw 13 RFPs totaling ~$3.9B. That clustered demand compresses timelines—and advantages teams that are ready now. ⏱️

What to prioritize:
• Budget and staffing earmarked for Q1/Q2 RFP sprints 📅
• Cross-functional diligence pods to accelerate turnarounds 🧠
• Standardized IC memos, model shells, and DDQs to reply in days, not weeks ⚙️
• Bigger tickets and leadership roles to secure better economics—especially with co-invest and club options 🤝
• Portfolio resilience: pacing plans, liquidity overlays, and dedicated co-invest sleeves to stay flexible while capturing alpha 💼

Agility is alpha this year. Institutional investors who pre-wire approvals and documentation can win mandates without sacrificing risk discipline.

Post 2 (economics + structure)
Competitive processes favor scale—if you’re set up to use it. In early 2025, 13 infra RFPs (~$3.9B) are crowding the calendar. Here’s how to turn that into pricing power: 📈

• Lead or anchor roles = stronger fee/term negotiations 💬
• Pair program commitments with structured co-invest rights to lift net IRR ⚖️
• Club deals can balance governance with speed—align on decisions upfront 🧩
• Pre-arranged liquidity buffers keep you offensive through cycles 💧
• Rapid, standardized diligence workflows reduce friction and signal readiness ⚡

This is the year to trade speed and certainty of capital for improved economics—and to lock in inflation-linked, durable cash flows.

Post 3 (operating model + resilience)
Agility isn’t a buzzword in 2025—it’s a core competency. With ~$3.9B of infra RFPs hitting in January, clustered timelines demand a different operating model. 🛠️

Winning model:
• Cross-functional “tiger teams” spanning investment, legal, ops, and ESG 🐯
• Pre-approved term sheets and playbooks for fast negotiation 📝
• Data room standards, DDQ libraries, and templated IC docs 📂
• Pacing plans with dedicated co-invest sleeves to capture upside without overextending 🧭
• Liquidity management to protect balance-sheet flexibility across vintages 🧱

Outcome: faster submissions, stronger economics, and portfolios built for durability—not just deployment.
