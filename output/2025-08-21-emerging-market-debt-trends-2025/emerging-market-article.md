# Emerging Market Debt Trends 2025: Where Risk Meets Opportunity for Institutional Portfolios

After three years of rate shock, restructurings, and a strong U.S. dollar, emerging market debt enters 2025 with unusually compelling starting yields and wide dispersion—conditions that historically favor selective, active investors. For institutions willing to lean into disciplined credit work and robust risk controls, the opportunity set spans hard- and local-currency sovereigns, quasi-sovereigns, and corporates. The playbook: harvest elevated carry, exploit dispersion via security selection, and manage policy/FX sensitivity with proven hedging and portfolio construction techniques. This article outlines how institutional allocators can position across hard- and local-currency exposures, manage restructuring risk, and implement robust practices to pursue excess return while maintaining discipline. It blends established industry frameworks with Dakota’s on-the-ground manager research to help you navigate a data-thin, fast-changing environment.

## Key Insights at a Glance
- Compelling carry: EM hard-currency sovereign benchmarks entered late-2024 yielding roughly 7–8%, with spreads around 350–450 bps over comparable U.S. Treasuries—well above pre-2020 levels (JPMorgan EMBI Global Diversified, 2024).
- Persistent dispersion: The 90th–10th percentile spread across EMBI country risk premia was over 600 bps in 2H24, creating a wide opportunity set for active selection (JPMorgan, 2024).
- Local inflation is falling: Median EM CPI fell from ~9% in 2022 to ~5% in late-2024, enabling policy easing cycles in multiple markets and improving real local yields (IMF, Oct 2024; Bloomberg, Dec 2024).
- Default cycles are advanced: The number of sovereigns engaged in restructuring since 2020 is the highest in decades, but recovery prospects have improved as frameworks mature and growth stabilizes in several issuers (S&P Global Ratings, 2024; World Bank, 2024).

Hard-currency sovereigns: where carry meets idiosyncrasy
- Setup. EM hard-currency debt offers a clean way to access sovereign and quasi-sovereign spreads without taking local FX risk. With all-in yields near cycle highs and spread dispersion still significant, 2025 favors security selection, curve positioning, and careful governance risk assessment over broad beta (JPMorgan, 2024; Moody’s, 2024).
- Duration and convexity. EMBI duration typically sits near 7–8 years, with spread duration similar, making positioning sensitive to both U.S. rate volatility and credit beta (JPMorgan, 2024). Allocators should explicitly budget “rates” versus “spreads” risk and consider overlays to separate the two.
- Country selection. Dakota’s manager research points to ongoing differentiation among commodity exporters versus importers, and reform-oriented governments versus those facing fiscal slippage. Recovery narratives in selected frontier names contrast with unresolved debt sustainability in others. For example, reform momentum tied to IMF programs historically correlates with spread compression over 6–18 months when performance targets are met (IMF, Oct 2024).
- Quasi-sovereigns. State-linked credits often trade with a mix of sovereign ceiling risk and sector fundamentals. In energy and utilities, deleveraging and liability management have improved credit metrics in several names, even as sovereign ratings lag; the resulting basis offers opportunities for relative-value pairs (Fitch Ratings, 2024; Moody’s, 2024).

Local-currency debt: disinflation, policy cycles, and FX
- Inflation and policy. A broad EM disinflation trend—helped by normalized supply chains and earlier, pre-emptive hikes—has lifted real policy rates and opened space for measured easing in 2025 (IMF, Oct 2024). Local curves price different paths: some markets embed prolonged tightness, others a quicker normalization.
- FX valuations. Real effective exchange rates in multiple EMs sit near or below decade averages, while external balances have generally improved, moderating vulnerability to shocks (BIS, 2024; World Bank, 2024). That supports selective local FX exposure if the U.S. dollar stabilizes or softens as U.S. inflation cools (Bloomberg, Dec 2024).
- Implementation. Local rates duration typically sits near 5–6 years for broad indices, with meaningful currency volatility. Institutions often separate local rates and FX via hedged sleeves, employing dynamic currency overlays based on carry, valuation, and balance-of-payments indicators (JPMorgan GBI-EM, 2024; BIS, 2024).
- Where to fish. Markets that hiked early and hard—now with positive real rates, credible disinflation, and improving fiscal anchors—may offer the best asymmetric setup for local duration. Conversely, countries with sticky core inflation or widening deficits demand stricter limits and tighter stop-loss protocols (IMF, Oct 2024).

Corporate credit in EM: improving balance sheets but refinancing watch
- Fundamentals. Many EM corporates termed out debt pre-2022, boosted cash flows from nominal GDP growth and commodities, and maintained interest coverage ratios above pre-Covid levels (S&P Global Ratings, 2024). The near-term maturity wall is manageable, but smaller high-yield issuers with limited market access remain a watchpoint.
- Differentiation. Sector and country segmentation is key: exporters with USD revenues but LC costs retain natural hedges; regulated utilities depend on tariff pass-through; real estate remains bifurcated by jurisdictional policy and funding channels (Moody’s, 2024; Fitch Ratings, 2024).
- Governance and covenants. Post-2020, documentation hardened in some segments, but covenant-lite persists elsewhere. Persistent minority shareholder risks in certain jurisdictions require higher spread compensation and tighter position limits (Moody’s, 2024).

Restructurings: a more navigable, though still slow, landscape
- The cycle. Since 2020, multiple sovereigns have defaulted or pursued debt treatments under the Common Framework or ad hoc negotiations, creating a broader distressed opportunity set (World Bank, 2024; IMF, Oct 2024).
- Recovery math. Historical sovereign recoveries cluster widely (30–70 cents), driven by debt sustainability paths, official sector participation, and energy/commodity cycles (S&P Global Ratings, 2024). For institutional portfolios, a rigorous, scenario-based expected recovery framework—paired with duration-to-catalyst discipline—is essential.
- Process risk. Timelines remain uncertain, but official-sector coordination has improved on comparability standards and treatment modalities, reducing tail uncertainty for some cases (IMF, Oct 2024). Dakota’s manager interviews suggest focusing on: clarity of fiscal anchors, realistic primary balance targets, and the feasibility of market re-access post-treatment.

Policy and FX cycle sensitivity: manage the macro, don’t bet the farm
- Fed path. EM beta to U.S. rates remains high; a benign “slow-cut” scenario supports carry and spread compression, while a repricing to higher-for-longer would pressure duration and lower-quality credits (Bloomberg, Dec 2024; BIS, 2024).
- Dollar dynamics. A firming USD tends to weigh on local FX and marginal borrowers; a steady-to-softer USD can unlock local currency returns. Use currency overlays and staggered hedging ratios to manage path risk (BIS, 2024).
- Commodities. Energy and metals price paths will continue to drive country dispersion. Terms-of-trade improvements provide fiscal space for exporters, while importers require tighter policy credibility (World Bank, 2024).

Portfolio construction: a durable, risk-aware framework
- Define roles and risk budgets. Segment the EM sleeve into: hard-currency sovereign core, local rates core, opportunistic/distressed, and EM corporates, each with explicit risk budgets for duration, spread beta, currency, and liquidity. Use tracking-error bands with factor-aware guardrails to avoid unintended macro bets (JPMorgan, 2024; BIS, 2024).
- Carry and convexity balance. Combine higher-carry, higher-vol sleeves (select HY sovereigns/distressed) with lower-vol anchors (IG quasi-sovereigns, high-quality locals). Target a portfolio-level yield pickup with diversified default and FX exposures.
- Liquidity management. Stress test for 2013/2020-style outflows: size cash buffers, ladder maturities, and favor benchmark-aware issue sizes when implementing in daily-liquidity vehicles (IIF, 2024; Bloomberg, Dec 2024).
- Drawdown controls. Implement multi-trigger risk controls: spread-widening stops, downgrade/event risk caps, and volatility-based de-risking rules. Maintain pre-approved hedges (rate futures, payer swaptions, FX forwards) for rapid deployment (BIS, 2024).

Hard-currency playbook for 2025
- Overweight resilient reformers; underweight fiscally fragile credits lacking credible anchors. Map each sovereign to a debt-sustainability quadrant: solvency vs. liquidity, policy credibility, and external buffers (IMF, Oct 2024).
- Curve positioning. Prefer belly exposures where roll-down is attractive and refinancing risk is modest; avoid long tails in names with uncertain official-sector trajectories (JPMorgan, 2024).
- Quasi-sovereign relative value. Exploit gaps between sovereign and quasi curves where operational metrics outpace sovereign rating momentum; hedge residual sovereign beta via CDS indices where appropriate (Fitch Ratings, 2024).

Local-currency playbook for 2025
- Rates vs. FX separation. Run a core local rates book with partial-to-full FX hedging, complemented by a high-conviction FX overlay sized to a strict VaR budget (BIS, 2024).
- Real yield screens. Focus on markets with ex-ante real policy rates >1–2% and credible disinflation glide paths. Align with central banks prioritizing inflation targeting and transparent communication (IMF, Oct 2024).
- Tactical overlays. Use conditional duration (receiver swaptions) to express easing views with limited downside; pair local duration longs with USD duration shorts if U.S. curve risk is elevated (Bloomberg, Dec 2024).

Corporate credit playbook for 2025
- Balance-sheet triage. Prioritize issuers with net leverage trending down, FX-matched cash flows, and manageable 2025–2027 maturities; avoid names reliant on single-bank channels (Moody’s, 2024).
- Security selection. In HY, prefer secured or structurally senior paper with hard-currency cash flows; in IG, emphasize quasi-sovereigns with improving standalone metrics (S&P Global Ratings, 2024).
- Active engagement. Covenant monitoring and dialogue with management remain edge drivers
