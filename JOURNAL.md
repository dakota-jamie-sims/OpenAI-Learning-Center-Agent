## 2025-08-21 - Major System Updates

### GPT-5 Integration Complete
- **CRITICAL**: Entire system now uses GPT-5 models via Responses API
- All components migrated from Chat Completions to Responses API
- Model selection optimized:
  - `gpt-5`: Complex tasks (orchestrator, writer, fact checking)
  - `gpt-5-mini`: Medium tasks (team leads, metadata, summaries)  
  - `gpt-5-nano`: Simple/fast tasks (SEO, social, KB search)

### Production KB Search Implemented
- **RESOLVED**: Fixed "OpenAI object has no attribute 'assistants'" error
- Created `kb_search_responses.py` using correct Responses API with file_search tool
- Real vector store search working (397 files in Dakota Knowledge Base)
- No more mock data - production ready
- Search times: ~10-15s for standard queries

### API Updates
- Responses API verbosity values: "low", "medium", "high" (not "concise", "verbose")
- Reasoning effort levels: "minimal", "low", "medium", "high"
- File search tool integrated with Responses API
- All agents use `query_llm()` which calls ResponsesClient

### Test Results
- ‚úÖ All GPT-5 models responding correctly
- ‚úÖ KB search returns real results from vector store
- ‚úÖ Multi-agent system working with GPT-5
- ‚úÖ Web search (Serper API) integrated
- ‚úÖ Full system test passed

### Key Files Created/Updated
- `/src/services/kb_search_responses.py` - Production KB search
- `/src/utils/responses_api.py` - Utility functions for Responses API
- `/src/config.py` - Updated DEFAULT_MODELS with GPT-5 variants
- `/tests/integration/test_gpt5_responses_api.py` - System verification test

### Cost Considerations
- GPT-5 models in use for all operations
- Estimated cost per article: ~$0.50-$1.50 depending on length
- KB search adds minimal cost (uses gpt-5-nano)

### Next Steps
- Monitor performance and costs in production
- Consider caching for KB search results
- Implement rate limiting if needed
- Add comprehensive logging for all Responses API calls

# TODO List

## Completed ‚úÖ
- [x] Implement production KB search (no mocks)
- [x] Fix OpenAI assistants API error
- [x] Migrate entire system to GPT-5 models
- [x] Update all components to use Responses API
- [x] Create utility functions for Responses API
- [x] Test full system with real KB search

- [ ] Add support for streaming responses
- [ ] Implement advanced prompt caching

## Future Enhancements üí°
- [ ] Integrate with Dakota's CRM for personalized content
- [ ] Add multi-language support
- [ ] Implement real-time collaboration features
- [ ] Create content templates for different article types
- [ ] Add automated SEO optimization

## Technical Debt üõ†Ô∏è
- [ ] Refactor duplicate code in orchestrator classes
- [ ] Standardize error handling across all services
