{'title': 'Q4 2022 13F High-Level Asset Class Update', 'introduction': 'Our last 13F update we reviewed the ETF product landscape and ETF flows trends which we saw occur among allocators via MarketPlace during 2022. Capping off the asset class flows we observed for Q4 2022, all allocators were operating in an market that now has the highest Fed Funds rate we have seen in 15 years. This adjustment has also occurred at the fastest pace investors have ever seen within a 12 month period. As we looked at Q4 13F data, we saw allocators begin to look toward the possible end of the fixed income yield and equity multiple adjustments they were positioning for earlier in the year. Chart 2 ETF-Asset Class Q3-2022 % of flows Q4-2022 % of flows US Equity 59,600,266,731 55% 64,039,588,500 32% Taxable Bond 54,301,000,000 50% 57,850,253,800 29% Municipal Bond 198,600,000 1% 15,559,840,277 8% Alternative 3,510,200,000 3.10% 3,010,050,276 1.57% Commodities -(12,100,320,000) -11.30% -(5,884,857,725) -0.03 Sector Specific Equity -(11,510,366,000) -10% 7,556,018,176 -0.039 Leveraged-Trading 5,740,560,465 5% 828,668,630 0.43 Intl Equity 3,400,282,000 3% 7,556,018,178 18% All through 2022 we had seen two major themes: US equity and US fixed income took the majority of the flows at 45% each, and second, passive ETF flows continued to grow in both equities and fixed income VS passive. In Q4, this trend reversed. Flows to passive US Equities ETFs dropped by over 20%, as did flows to passive Fixed Income. While active ETFs in both categories grew, especially in active Fixed Income ETFs in Q4 as they grew over $3B in net flows. It is also worth noting as we reviewed Q4 Lipper Fund data, that the year long trend of active mutual funds losing assets to passive mutual funds also reversed as the share of actively managed assets had a slight increase during Q4 vs passive funds. Taking the market impact into account, the total net ETF assets tracked via 13Fs during the 4th quarter increased approximately 10% from $5.9 trillion in Q3 to Q4 at $6.528 Trillion, with active ETFs at 5.5% of total assets despite having 1026 active ETF strategies. Some additional observations: While US equity flows dropped, we saw a massive uptick in international equity flows increasing 15% Muni bonds increase flows by over 7% , mainly in short term Munis Alts and leveraged trading ETFs saw a decrease in interest as flows have flatlined Commodity related ETFs again saw a large decrease in net flows as global commodity supply fears continue to moderate VS this time last year, however the outflows are moderating Chart 3 Sub -Asset Class Flows of Note Q2-2022 % of flows Q3-2022 % of flows Allocation Funds 16,900,757 -1.00% 584,170,300 1.00% Emerging Market Equity -(14,670,050,800) -1.00% 8,502,800,420 4.50% Global Large Blend -(1,027,003,222) -2.00% 5,210,677,997 3.00% Global Listed Real Estate -(56,370,901) -0.03% 520,890,400 0.50% Small Cap Blend Equity -(281,411,200) -2.60% 5,254,800,000 -3.00% Preferreds -(238,100,400) -0.20% -(1,101,225,081) -1.50% Muni Bonds-int term 9,236,000,000 9.10% 94,250,220 0.10% EM Bonds-local and USD -(3,587,368) -1.00% 891,411,600 2.00% Similar to last quarter, the flows we saw via 13 ETF data were not mirrored in mutual funds as Lipper reported continued net outflows in all major asset classes. For an asset manager, this underscores why it is important to look at all vehicles for each addressable asset class as they may tell a different story depending on the vehicle being used by allocators. Looking under the hood at the sub-asset classes there were some trends of note: Active and passive allocation ETFs saw the first positive flows of the year. With many moving away from blended portfolios for the past year, we started to see some move back toward stock/bond blends again. This corroborates with the flatness in Alternative flows we saw. Sector wise, global real estate/REITs swung to positive for the first time this year. EM equities had a massive flip to positive during the quarter. We have noted allocations made by pension funds via our Public Pension Notes to EME all during the year, now we are seeing this trend extend to retail allocators EM debt also saw a flip to positive flows for the first time in 2022, bent toward EM Local Debt as local tends to outperform in flat to down USD markets.

{'title': 'From Tedious to Transformative: How Past Activity Reports Turn CRM Logging into Sales Success', 'introduction': 'Let’s be honest. Logging meetings into your CRM? It’s… not fun. You’d probably rather do just about anything else. In fact, most investment sales pros have a love-hate relationship with their CRM. It’s clunky. It’s another thing on the list. And honestly, didn’t that notepad or Excel sheet work just fine? Well, here’s the problem: three months from now, when you’re trying to remember the name of the analyst in Cincinnati who seemed interested in your strategy, you’ll be scrolling through emails, squinting at scribbled notes, and wishing you’d just logged the details in your CRM. And that’s not even the worst part. Without proper tracking, it’s all too easy to miss critical follow-up windows or let promising leads fade into the background. The good news? Your CRM can do this with one click. It’s actually the key to keeping every client engagement alive and well. In this article, we’re going to explain the importance of utilizing past activity reports. By the end, you’ll have a better understanding of how this one-click strategy can take you from CRM skeptic to CRM savant – and keep you closing deals and building relationships like a pro. Why Logging Every Meeting in Your CRM Matters We get it; inputting every meeting feels tedious. But in investment sales, each follow-up, every tiny detail, and even those brief calls can shape your future interactions. Logging all these touch points into your CRM builds a robust record, giving you the inside track to engage with clients meaningfully and systematically. It’s not just about filing away names and dates, it’s about setting yourself up to re-engage, consistently, with real insights at your fingertips. New call-to-action Past Activity Reports: Your CRM’s Hidden Treasure Trove Now, here’s where it gets good. Once your meetings and calls are logged, you can run past activity reports – essentially one of your CRM’s greatest superpower. These reports offer quick, at-a-glance snapshots of your client interactions over time, typically in thirty-day, sixty-day, and ninety-day windows. Each timeframe gives you an organized view of recent activities, making it easy to spot who needs a follow-up, when, and why. Say you’re looking at your thirty-day report. You’ll immediately see who’s fresh off a meeting and ready for a re-connect. That sixty-day report? It’s perfect for keeping folks on your radar. And the ninety-day view helps you revive any cold leads before they go completely dark. Think of these reports as “who-to-contact” guides that make follow-up feel like second nature. You’ll thank yourself when you realize it only takes one click. Turning Past Activity into Sales Triggers Running regular past activity reports is more than a CRM routine; it’s a way to trigger the next step in your client relationships. Every report you generate isn’t just a static list, it’s a clear call to action. Here’s what these reports set in motion: Quick Follow-Ups: Just finished a promising call? The thirty-day report will remind you it’s time to reach out, keeping momentum strong. Keeping Conversations Fresh: The sixty-day report helps you stay in touch without letting things go stale. Reviving the Cold Leads: If a prospect hasn’t heard from you in three months, the ninety-day report reminds you it’s time to spark the conversation back up. These sales triggers eliminate guesswork, making follow-up a natural extension of your routine rather than a haphazard task on your to-do list. How Regular Report Reviews Build Consistency and Efficiency Consistency is key in investment sales, and by making past activity reports a habit, you turn follow-up into a reliable, systematic part of your workflow. Plus, the one-click simplicity of generating these reports saves you from wading through endless notes or trying to remember “that guy from the last meeting.” With regular reviews, you create a steady rhythm in your sales pipeline, ensuring that no client or prospect slips through the cracks. It’s proactive sales management without all the hassle. New call-to-action Picture this: you’re convinced that you last met with a prospect in Cincinnati just last month. But one look at your ninety-day report, and surprise - it’s been three months since you’ve connected. Time flies, and these reports keep you in check, giving you a nudge before important relationships fade away. In an industry where timing is critical, these reports are your insurance against missed opportunities. Making Past Activity Reports a Cornerstone of Your Sales Strategy The real value of past activity reports lies in how they transform your CRM data into powerful, actionable insights. By regularly reviewing and acting on these reports, you turn your CRM from a data graveyard into a thriving source of opportunity. Here’s how to make the most of it: Set a Review Schedule: Commit to weekly or monthly reviews of your thirty-day, sixty-day, and ninety-day reports. This routine keeps you consistently engaged with your client base. Use Triggers Regularly: Each report should drive specific follow-up actions. A thirty-day report might prompt a friendly “just checking in” email, while the ninety-day one cues up a more strategic conversation. Track and Refine Your Approach: Over time, patterns will emerge. You’ll learn which follow-ups yield the best results, allowing you to fine-tune your outreach for maximum impact. With a single click, these reports give you instant access to a complete view of your client interactions, making follow-up a seamless, strategic part of your routine. By making past activity reports a habit, you’ll keep your CRM organized, your sales pipeline active, and your relationships moving forward. Over time, this straightforward practice becomes a powerful tool for sustained growth and client engagement. So, yes - your CRM might feel like a chore today. But with past activity reports, it’s your roadmap to success. Embrace these one-click insights, and watch as your client relationships deepen, your follow-up becomes second nature, and your investment sales strategy hits new heights.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'From Tedious to Transformative: How Past Activity Reports Turn CRM Logging into Sales Success', 'content': 'Let’s be honest.

Why Logging Every Meeting in Your CRM Matters We get it; inputting every meeting feels tedious. But in investment sales, each follow-up, every tiny detail, and even those brief calls can shape your future interactions. Logging all these touch points into your CRM builds a robust record, giving you the inside track to engage with clients meaningfully and systematically. It’s not just about filing away names and dates, it’s about setting yourself up to re-engage, consistently, with real insights at your fingertips. New call-to-action Past Activity Reports: Your CRM’s Hidden Treasure Trove Now, here’s where it gets good. Once your meetings and calls are logged, you can run past activity reports – essentially one of your CRM’s greatest superpower. These reports offer quick, at-a-glance snapshots of your client interactions over time, typically in thirty-day, sixty-day, and ninety-day windows. Each timeframe gives you an organized view of recent activities, making it easy to spot who needs a follow-up, when, and why. Say you’re looking at your thirty-day report. You’ll immediately see who’s fresh off a meeting and ready for a re-connect. That sixty-day report? It’s perfect for keeping folks on your radar. And the ninety-day view helps you revive any cold leads before they go completely dark. Think of these reports as “who-to-contact” guides that make follow-up feel like second nature. You’ll thank yourself when you realize it only takes one click. Turning Past Activity into Sales Triggers Running regular past activity reports is more than a CRM routine; it’s a way to trigger the next step in your client relationships. Every report you generate isn’t just a static list, it’s a clear call to action. Here’s what these reports set in motion: Quick Follow-Ups: Just finished a promising call? The thirty-day report will remind you it’s time to reach out, keeping momentum strong. Keeping Conversations Fresh: The sixty-day report helps you stay in touch without letting things go stale. Reviving the Cold Leads: If a prospect hasn’t heard from you in three months, the ninety-day report reminds you it’s time to spark the conversation back up. These sales triggers eliminate guesswork, making follow-up a natural extension of your routine rather than a haphazard task on your to-do list. How Regular Report Reviews Build Consistency and Efficiency Consistency is key in investment sales, and by making past activity reports a habit, you turn follow-up into a reliable, systematic part of your workflow. Plus, the one-click simplicity of generating these reports saves you from wading through endless notes or trying to remember “that guy from the last meeting.” With regular reviews, you create a steady rhythm in your sales pipeline, ensuring that no client or prospect slips through the cracks. It’s proactive sales management without all the hassle. New call-to-action Picture this: you’re convinced that you last met with a prospect in Cincinnati just last month. But one look at your ninety-day report, and surprise - it’s been three months since you’ve connected. Time flies, and these reports keep you in check, giving you a nudge before important relationships fade away. In an industry where timing is critical, these reports are your insurance against missed opportunities. Making Past Activity Reports a Cornerstone of Your Sales Strategy The real value of past activity reports lies in how they transform your CRM data into powerful, actionable insights. By regularly reviewing and acting on these reports, you turn your CRM from a data graveyard into a thriving source of opportunity. Here’s how to make the most of it: Set a Review Schedule: Commit to weekly or monthly reviews of your thirty-day, sixty-day, and ninety-day reports. This routine keeps you consistently engaged with your client base. Use Triggers Regularly: Each report should drive specific follow-up actions. A thirty-day report might prompt a friendly “just checking in” email, while the ninety-day one cues up a more strategic conversation. Track and Refine Your Approach: Over time, patterns will emerge. You’ll learn which follow-ups yield the best results, allowing you to fine-tune your outreach for maximum impact. With a single click, these reports give you instant access to a complete view of your client interactions, making follow-up a seamless, strategic part of your routine. By making past activity reports a habit, you’ll keep your CRM organized, your sales pipeline active, and your relationships moving forward. Over time, this straightforward practice becomes a powerful tool for sustained growth and client engagement. So, yes - your CRM might feel like a chore today. But with past activity reports, it’s your roadmap to success. Embrace these one-click insights, and watch as your client relationships deepen, your follow-up becomes second nature, and your investment sales strategy hits new heights.', 'bullet_points': [], 'subsections': []}], 'key_takeaways': [], 'faqs': []}

{'title': 'The Powerful Impact of a CRM and a Salesforce Integration', 'introduction': 'At the core of investment sales is the need for precise tracking of all meetings scheduled and meeting notes. CRM systems offer a centralized platform for monitoring all interactions and meetings scheduled and completed. This level of tracking ensures no detail, no matter how small, is overlooked. For investment sales teams, this translates into a comprehensive understanding of client needs and preferences, enabling a more personalized approach in their sales strategies. This is where a CRM system comes into play. For the sake of this article let’s use Salesforce as our chosen CRM system. However, we have another article on the top CRM systems for investment firms to check out. This article is for any sales professional with a Salesforce CRM, or any sales professional interested in a Salesforce integration. Salesforce, when configured properly, helps to streamline operations and manage massive amounts of data easily.  CRM’s can propel your firm into another dimension in terms of efficiency and fundraising efforts because it is such a pivotal tool for sales teams. In this article, we are going to focus on three powerful impacts to implementing your CRM and / or Salesforce integration. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of these impacts for your investment firm. Let’s move into the first benefit, and probably the most important. 1. Communication and Accountability In any job, sales especially, it is so critical to have a plan and be able to report back against the plan. With your CEO or manager, make sure you agree on what this plan is and what success looks like. Salesforce’s CRM enables sales to teams to easily communicate progress against a sales plan, mostly with one click of a button. This makes it easy to ensure everyone is aligned with the sales objectives and strategies. This level of communication is key to staying on track with their progress against the sales plan. 2. Tracking Meetings Scheduled Secondly, after implementing your Salesforce CRM, you and your team will leverage your time through tracking all meetings schedule. A salesperson needs to be able to track all past meetings with meeting notes as well as setting tasks for the next time they should reach out. This allows a salesperson to easily run a report on past activity to trigger sales actions. This is too hard to do with excel, word or yellow pads of paper. Without a CRM, this task becomes too tedious and gets lost in the other miscellaneous things you must do during the day. Entering meetings notes directly into your Salesforce CRM instead of writing them on paper or typing them into a word document easily reminds you with a few clicks of what you last talked about, and the appropriate next time to reach out. The ability to track these meetings within the CRM ensures that no detail is missed, fostering a more cohesive and informed sales strategy. This feature is vital in ensuring all team members are on the same page and that crucial meeting takeaways are captured and actioned upon. Effective CRM systems like Salesforce provide unparalleled capabilities in tracking internal meetings. 3. Maximizing Opportunities for Success Thirdly, a Salesforce CRM and integration ultimately allows you to maximize opportunities for success in investment sales. Salesforce allows each salesperson to approach their role as an individual business person, with their set of goals and priorities.

These can be addressed through practical solutions like incentivizing use through commission structures and providing visual pipeline displays.

# article_306_the-top-10-rias-in-baltimore

{'title': 'The Top 10 RIAs in Baltimore', 'introduction': "If you're in investment sales, you likely already know that one of the biggest problems of selling to the RIA  channel is the sheer size of it. The RIA market across the United States consists of over 36,000 firms, which means that while there are more than enough to choose from when looking for new clients, narrowing down the list to only those that allocate to outside managers is going to be key. Here at Dakota, we’ve raised over $6 billion from over 350 RIAs, and that has been possible because we qualify and curate our list to only RIAs that allocate to outside managers. In an effort to help narrow down the sheer size of the market, we’ve put together a list of the top 10 RIAs in each major metro area across the country. To determine our list, we looked for three things: An AUM above $200 million A dedicated analyst team An RIA that actively allocates capital to outside investment management firms In this article, we're highlighting the top 10 RIAs in Baltimore, Maryland from our curated institutional investor database, Dakota Marketplace.

# article_302_how-to-use-custom-lists-in-your-crm-to-improve-sal

{'title': 'How to Use Custom Lists in Your CRM to Improve Sales Efficiency', 'introduction': "By now, if you’re a salesperson, you already know the importance of entering (clean, accurate) data into your CRM. Whether you’re using Salesforce, Hubspot, or something else entirely, in order to make progress, your sales team needs to know who they’ve called on, and who they’re targeting in the future. It may sound simple, but many investment firms aren’t doing this in the most efficient way possible. At Dakota, we’ve always used Salesforce as our CRM, and have since 2006. In that time, we’ve established the processes and best practices needed to raise over $40 billion for our partners. How? Through a lot of time, trial and error, and clean data. Oh, and custom lists in Salesforce, which is what we’re here to talk about today. In this article, we’ll be highlighting the importance of clean and accurate data and custom list building for success in your CRM. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear idea of the next steps you can take within your own CRM to create more efficiency for your sales team. First, we’ll jump into the importance of clean data. Does Clean Data Really Matter? If you’ve been around here a while, you already know that our answer is an unequivocal yes. Without clean data, your CRM is rendered almost useless. Plus, if your sales team is constantly logging into a CRM and seeing stale, outdated data, they won’t be motivated to use it. So, it all starts with creating a culture of clean data within your firm. Motivate your sales team to put their meeting notes and data into the CRM right after they have them. In our experience, this is the hardest part, as salespeople are inclined to wait until the end of the week or the month For us, it’s Salesforce and Marketplace. For another firm, it could just be their CRM, and as we’ve said again and again, one of the most important things about a CRM is the ability to get a glance into the information that matters most to a particular salesperson. This brings us to our next point: custom lists. What is a custom list and why does it matter? One of the most effective ways to see the most important CRM data at a glance is to build custom lists. A Salesforce custom list view can help users to grab and segment data at a moment's notice – without the need for admin support. These lists allow you to display up to 15 fields of your choice on a list view, and these fields can be changed and rearranged depending on your needs. To do this, you’re going to create custom lists in the report section of your CRM based upon the information that you want to see. For instance, say you just want to see a list in your database of all the hedge fund buyers, or a list of all the private equity buyers, or you want to see a list of all your RIA’s above $5 billion. You can begin creating all of these different custom lists by geography, by account type, by investment preferences, and by any other relevant fields depending on the goals of your firm. This can help to double the effectiveness of a salesperson, because they can then focus their time on immediately just going in and seeing who they should be calling on and making their sales calls versus having to search around. This creates extreme efficiency. You can create thousands of different custom lists so you can chunk information down into very digestible bites so you can focus. At Dakota, this is what we do for our members, because we know that one of the biggest challenges a lot of us face when it comes to a CRM is incomplete data. If it's not organized and up to date, it’s essentially useless. Marketplace provides that updated data, and allows for list views that empower your sales team to be incredibly efficient. To learn more about Dakota Marketplace and list building, we’d love to offer you a free trial of Dakota Marketplace, so you can increase the efficiency of your sales team without the hassle of constantly updating your data.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'How to Use Custom Lists in Your CRM to Improve Sales Efficiency', 'content': "By now, if you’re a salesperson, you already know the importance of entering (clean, accurate) data into your CRM. Whether you’re using Salesforce, Hubspot, or something else entirely, in order to make progress, your sales team needs to know who they’ve called on, and who they’re targeting in the future. It may sound simple, but many investment firms aren’t doing this in the most efficient way possible. At Dakota, we’ve always used Salesforce as our CRM, and have since 2006. In that time, we’ve established the processes and best practices needed to raise over $40 billion for our partners. How? Through a lot of time, trial and error, and clean data. Oh, and custom lists in Salesforce, which is what we’re here to talk about today. In this article, we’ll be highlighting the importance of clean and accurate data and custom list building for success in your CRM. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear idea of the next steps you can take within your own CRM to create more efficiency for your sales team. First, we’ll jump into the importance of clean data. Does Clean Data Really Matter? If you’ve been around here a while, you already know that our answer is an unequivocal yes. Without clean data, your CRM is rendered almost useless. Plus, if your sales team is constantly logging into a CRM and seeing stale, outdated data, they won’t be motivated to use it. So, it all starts with creating a culture of clean data within your firm. Motivate your sales team to put their meeting notes and data into the CRM right after they have them. In our experience, this is the hardest part, as salespeople are inclined to wait until the end of the week or the month For us, it’s Salesforce and Marketplace. For another firm, it could just be their CRM, and as we’ve said again and again, one of the most important things about a CRM is the ability to get a glance into the information that matters most to a particular salesperson. This brings us to our next point: custom lists. What is a custom list and why does it matter? One of the most effective ways to see the most important CRM data at a glance is to build custom lists. A Salesforce custom list view can help users to grab and segment data at a moment's notice – without the need for admin support. These lists allow you to display up to 15 fields of your choice on a list view, and these fields can be changed and rearranged depending on your needs. To do this, you’re going to create custom lists in the report section of your CRM based upon the information that you want to see. For instance, say you just want to see a list in your database of all the hedge fund buyers, or a list of all the private equity buyers, or you want to see a list of all your RIA’s above $5 billion. You can begin creating all of these different custom lists by geography, by account type, by investment preferences, and by any other relevant fields depending on the goals of your firm. This can help to double the effectiveness of a salesperson, because they can then focus their time on immediately just going in and seeing who they should be calling on and making their sales calls versus having to search around. This creates extreme efficiency. You can create thousands of different custom lists so you can chunk information down into very digestible bites so you can focus. At Dakota, this is what we do for our members, because we know that one of the biggest challenges a lot of us face when it comes to a CRM is incomplete data. If it's not organized and up to date, it’s essentially useless. Marketplace provides that updated data, and allows for list views that empower your sales team to be incredibly efficient.

{'title': 'The Growth of Private Investment Strategies', 'introduction': "Over the last few years, the private equity landscape has experienced remarkable growth. It has become an essential component of the financial markets and a critical tool for investment sales managers. With more than 18,000 private equity funds in existence today, nearly a 60% increase in the last five years alone, the sector has expanded its influence. At Dakota, our investment sales team has seen this shift from public to private markets come to fruition as we’ve been fundraising since 2006 and raised over $30 billion on behalf of our partners. Their CRM is the database we sell today, Dakota Marketplace, making it uniquely built by fundraisers for fundraisers. As private fund allocations grow, allocators face the challenge of navigating vast amounts of complex data. We aim to simplify this process by offering tools and insights that help allocators make informed decisions.

# article_089_family-office-expansion-equals-opportunity-competi

{'title': 'Family Office Expansion Equals Opportunity, Competition for Alts', 'introduction': 'The continued rapid growth in the number of family offices and the wealth they control could represent both an opportunity and an emerging form of competition for private equity firms and private fund managers more broadly. According to a September survey report from Deloitte Private, family offices worldwide are expected to grow to 10,720 by 2030, a 33% increase from 8,030 in 2024 and a staggering 75% from 6,130 in 2019. This growth in family offices is closely linked to the rise in global family wealth, with Deloitte estimating family offices’ assets under management (AUM) will increase to $5.4T by 2030, up 73% from $3.1T today. Meanwhile, North America is expected to nearly double its family offices by 2030, while Asia Pacific is forecasted to experience the fastest growth of global regions. Deloitte says this surge in the number of family offices reflects broader trends in wealth accumulation, generational wealth transfers, and the growing sophistication of family office structures. The Shift to Private Markets and Increased Competition With public markets continuing to shrink and private markets going the other way, it’s no surprise that family offices are also increasingly investing in alternatives, with a May 2023 survey from Goldman Sachs estimating alts make up, on average, 44% of family office portfolios. Similarly, a May 2024 survey report from Deloitte Private found that private equity has officially surpassed public equity as the top asset class in family office portfolios, with private equity now accounting for 30% of family office investments, up strongly from 22% in 2021. Public equities have taken the opposite tack, falling to 25% of the allocation in family office portfolios from 34% in 2021. “Increasingly [family offices] are putting their money into private markets … and moving away from public equities, and their favored allocation for this year is private credit, followed by real estate and private equity.” CNBC wealth editor Robert Frank reported in April. “All of Wall Street is trying to tap this market. Private banks, wealth management companies, private equity firms all have these new family office groups targeting this group for capital.” But family offices may also be a growing source of competition in buyout and private credit deals, Frank said. “They\'re also replacing traditional private equity in many big deals, increasingly large deals in fact,” he said, referencing as evidence Michael Dell\'s family office’s participation in the blockbuster $13B deal to take entertainment, sports, and media company Endeavor Holdings private in April, and a family-office-led private consortium that acquired oil and gas company PureWest for $1.8B in May 2023. He added that family offices’ favorite sectors for direct investment at the moment include biotech, artificial intelligence (AI), and health care. That lines up with a June survey of family offices by BNY Mellon Wealth Management, where a majority of respondents reported making at least six direct investments, either buying a stake in a private company or providing credit. And Deloitte’s May survey found that family offices increasingly prefer direct private equity investments, which now boast an average allocation of 17% of their portfolios, over investing in private equity funds, with an average allocation of 10%. In the end, it could be something of a "rising tide lifts all boats” scenario for private equity firms and private fund managers, where there is both increased competition with family offices for deals but also increased capital flows from them. Family office survey respondents told Deloitte they intend to increase their allocation to private equity investments more than any other asset class in 2024, with 27% expecting to increase their direct private investments and 25% their direct lending, while 29% intend to increase their allocation to private equity funds.

{'title': 'Best RIA Aggregators for Advisors & Asset Managers in 2025', 'introduction': "Over the past several years, the RIA industry has seen a dramatic rise in mergers and acquisitions, resulting in significant consolidation across the channel. This trend has been driven by private equity investment, advisor succession planning, and the increasing need for scale in areas like compliance, technology, and operations.

Best Practices for Navigating RIA Aggregators When selling to RIA aggregators, it's essential to understand their structure and decision-making processes. Each aggregator typically has a centralized home office research team responsible for curating approved lists of investment strategies, maintaining select lists and model portfolios, and managing access to alternative investments. These teams play a key role in gatekeeping investment opportunities on behalf of their advisory network and clients. However, many of these platforms also consist of individual underlying RIA teams or “child accounts” that conduct their own due diligence across asset classes. These teams can serve as important advocates for getting your strategy evaluated and ultimately placed on the platform. In Dakota Marketplace , we’ve listed both the centralized home office research contacts for each aggregator, as well as the underlying advisory teams. This visibility allows investment sales professionals to identify and prioritize the right points of contact, whether targeting the home office or starting with teams that can influence adoption from the ground up.

# article_173_a-guide-to-the-7-best-practices-for-interviewing-f

{'title': 'A Guide to the 7 Best Practices for Interviewing for an Investment Sales Job', 'introduction': "Navigating the world of sales job interviews can often feel like an art form, a delicate balance between showcasing your prowess, understanding the product or service you'll be selling, and aligning with the company culture. With the evolution of sales roles and the increasing sophistication of interview processes, standing out as a candidate requires more than just a polished resume and a firm handshake. Excelling in interviews is not just about showcasing your financial acumen but also about demonstrating your ability to build trust, communicate effectively, and align with the strategic goals of the institution you aim to represent. Drawing from years of experience and countless interactions with both candidates and hiring managers, I've distilled essential interview tips that can set you apart in this niche field. In this blog post, we'll dive deep into the seven best practices for interviewing for an investment sales job gathered from insights and strategies that have proven effective across various industries. After reading this you’ll have a better understanding of the tips and tricks we’ve gathered with 30 years of experience in the industry in order to help you stand out from the crowd. 1. Understand the product inside and out Understanding the product inside and out is not just a tip for acing a sales interview; it's an essential strategy for anyone looking to excel in the competitive field of institutional investment sales. In this industry, the products and services you're selling are often complex, involving intricate financial instruments or investment strategies. A superficial understanding simply won't cut it. You need to dive deep into the nuances of the product, including its features, benefits, and most critically, the specific problem it solves for its target customers. This depth of knowledge serves multiple purposes allowing you to answer questions with confidence and precision. It also allows you to demonstrate your genuine interest and commitment to the role and the product, which is a key differentiator in a crowded job market. Being able to articulate not just what the product is, but how it stands out in the marketplace, its competitive advantages, and the value it offers to clients, shows that you're not just there to sell, but to solve real-world problems. Your ability to effectively communicate the product's value during the interview is a direct indicator of your potential performance on the job. It reflects your ability to react, your ability to engage and persuade, and your capacity to build trust with prospective clients. In institutional investment sales, where relationships and credibility are paramount, this ability can set you apart as a top-tier candidate. Remember, your goal in the interview is not just to inform but to convince the interviewer that you are the best person to bring this product to market. 2. Tailor your sales philosophy to the company's culture Tailoring your sales philosophy to match the company's culture is a critical strategy for standing out in the competitive landscape of institutional investment sales. Each firm operates within its own unique ecosystem, driven by a distinct sales culture and philosophy that shapes its approach to client engagement and market positioning. For instance, some firms might prioritize building deep, long-term relationships with their clients, focusing on understanding their needs and providing tailored investment solutions. Others might emphasize the importance of high-volume transactions, speed, and efficiency, or they might be at the forefront of incorporating cutting-edge technology and data analytics to drive sales strategies. To truly resonate with your potential employer during the interview, it's imperative to conduct thorough research into the company's sales strategy, ethos, and how they perceive their relationship with clients. This research will enable you to craft responses that not only showcase your skills and experiences but also demonstrate how they align with the company's specific approach. Demonstrating this level of adaptability and alignment with the company's sales culture signals to your potential employer that you're not just a capable sales professional but also a seamless fit for their team. It shows that you're not only interested in the role but also committed to contributing to the company's success in a way that resonates with their values and objectives. 3. Showcase your soft skills In the realm of sales, especially within the nuanced and high-stakes environment of institutional investment sales, the importance of soft skills cannot be overstated. Emotional intelligence, communication prowess, adaptability, and problem-solving capabilities are not just nice-to-haves; they are essential tools that empower sales professionals to excel. These skills facilitate the navigation of complex negotiations, the forging and maintenance of robust customer relationships, and the ability to stay agile in the face of market volatility. When preparing for your job interview, reflect on your professional experiences to identify specific instances where these skills played a pivotal role. Perhaps you leveraged your emotional intelligence to salvage a potentially lost client relationship, or used your exceptional communication skills to simplify and sell a complex investment product. Maybe your adaptability allowed you to swiftly pivot strategies in response to market changes, leading to significant wins for your team. Through providing concrete examples of these soft skills in action, you underscore your holistic value as a sales professional. In a competitive job market, showcasing these soft skills can significantly differentiate you, illustrating that you possess both the technical acumen and the interpersonal finesse to thrive in a sales role. 4. Prepare for behavioral questions Behavioral questions are a staple of sales job interviews, as they allow interviewers to understand how you've handled real-world situations in the past. These questions often revolve around specific scenarios, such as managing a difficult customer interaction, surpassing ambitious sales targets, or fostering teamwork in high-stress situations. To effectively address these questions, familiarize yourself with the STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result. This structured approach encourages you to outline the context of the challenge (Situation), define your responsibilities (Task), describe the steps you took to address the challenge (Action), and conclude with the outcomes of your efforts (Result). Preparing your answers using this framework can significantly enhance the quality of your responses, making you a more compelling candidate by showcasing your capacity to handle the complex and dynamic challenges inherent in sales roles. 5. Ask insightful questions Asking insightful questions during a job interview is a powerful way to demonstrate your engagement, curiosity, and strategic thinking. It's essential to remember that an interview is indeed a two-way street; while the interviewer assesses your fit for the role, you are also evaluating the company's fit for your career aspirations. Preparing a list of thoughtful questions reflects your serious interest in the role and the company, and it can significantly influence the interviewer's perception of you as a candidate. These might include inquiries about the sales team's structure, the company's strategy for new market entry, or the biggest challenges facing the sales department. Asking about development opportunities and career progression can also underscore your long-term interest in the company. By asking these types of questions, you not only gather valuable information to help you decide if the company is the right fit for you, but you also position yourself as a thoughtful, proactive, and strategic candidate who is genuinely interested in making a meaningful contribution to the company. 6. Demonstrate your sales process Preparing to demonstrate your sales process in an interview is a proactive and impactful way to showcase your expertise and readiness for the role. This demonstration, whether it's through a brief presentation or a role-play exercise, offers a tangible glimpse into your approach to sales, from the initial prospecting phase through to the closing of a deal. It's an opportunity to not just tell but show how you navigate the sales cycle, apply strategic thinking, and utilize your communication skills to engage and persuade potential clients. Tailor this demonstration to the company's product or service, showing how you would approach the entire sales cycle from prospecting to closing. This practical demonstration can provide a powerful testament to your sales skills and your ability to hit the ground running. The practical showcase of your sales process can significantly set you apart from other candidates by providing a direct insight into your methodology, your ability to think on your feet, and your preparedness to contribute from day one. Moreover, it illustrates your commitment to the role and your willingness to go the extra mile in your preparation, underscoring your professionalism and dedication to achieving sales success. 7. Leverage your network Networking can play a crucial role in your job search, especially in sales where relationships are key. The importance of networking cannot be overstated; it's a dynamic resource that can provide you with insider insights, advice, and even referrals that are not accessible through conventional job search methods. In the context of preparing for a job interview, reaching out to your contacts who are familiar with the company, or even better, directly connected to it, can be a game-changer. Moreover, these conversations can reveal the company's strategic priorities and how the sales role contributes to achieving them, allowing you to position yourself as the candidate who can address these priorities effectively. Utilizing your network in this way not only enriches your understanding of the company but also demonstrates your initiative and thoroughness in preparing for the interview. It shows that you're not just interested in any job but are specifically committed to succeeding in this role at this company, leveraging every available resource to ensure you're the best fit. Putting it all together Interviewing for a sales job is an opportunity to showcase not just your sales skills, but your ability to adapt, learn, and grow within a company. By understanding the product deeply, aligning your sales philosophy with the company culture, highlighting your soft skills, and preparing thoroughly for behavioral questions, you can stand out as a candidate. Remember, the sales job interview is ultimately a sales pitch where the product is yourself. Use this opportunity to demonstrate why you're the best choice for the role, and how you can contribute to the company's success. In the fast-paced and ever-evolving world of sales, those who prepare diligently, approach interviews strategically, and showcase their unique value proposition are the ones who will ultimately succeed.

Coming soon!", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'A Guide to the 7 Best Practices for Interviewing for an Investment Sales Job', 'content': "Navigating the world of sales job interviews can often feel like an art form, a delicate balance between showcasing your prowess, understanding the product or service you'll be selling, and aligning with the company culture. With the evolution of sales roles and the increasing sophistication of interview processes, standing out as a candidate requires more than just a polished resume and a firm handshake. Excelling in interviews is not just about showcasing your financial acumen but also about demonstrating your ability to build trust, communicate effectively, and align with the strategic goals of the institution you aim to represent. Drawing from years of experience and countless interactions with both candidates and hiring managers, I've distilled essential interview tips that can set you apart in this niche field. In this blog post, we'll dive deep into the seven best practices for interviewing for an investment sales job gathered from insights and strategies that have proven effective across various industries. After reading this you’ll have a better understanding of the tips and tricks we’ve gathered with 30 years of experience in the industry in order to help you stand out from the crowd. 1. Understand the product inside and out Understanding the product inside and out is not just a tip for acing a sales interview; it's an essential strategy for anyone looking to excel in the competitive field of institutional investment sales. In this industry, the products and services you're selling are often complex, involving intricate financial instruments or investment strategies. A superficial understanding simply won't cut it. You need to dive deep into the nuances of the product, including its features, benefits, and most critically, the specific problem it solves for its target customers. This depth of knowledge serves multiple purposes allowing you to answer questions with confidence and precision. It also allows you to demonstrate your genuine interest and commitment to the role and the product, which is a key differentiator in a crowded job market. Being able to articulate not just what the product is, but how it stands out in the marketplace, its competitive advantages, and the value it offers to clients, shows that you're not just there to sell, but to solve real-world problems. Your ability to effectively communicate the product's value during the interview is a direct indicator of your potential performance on the job. It reflects your ability to react, your ability to engage and persuade, and your capacity to build trust with prospective clients. In institutional investment sales, where relationships and credibility are paramount, this ability can set you apart as a top-tier candidate. Remember, your goal in the interview is not just to inform but to convince the interviewer that you are the best person to bring this product to market. 2. Tailor your sales philosophy to the company's culture Tailoring your sales philosophy to match the company's culture is a critical strategy for standing out in the competitive landscape of institutional investment sales. Each firm operates within its own unique ecosystem, driven by a distinct sales culture and philosophy that shapes its approach to client engagement and market positioning. For instance, some firms might prioritize building deep, long-term relationships with their clients, focusing on understanding their needs and providing tailored investment solutions. Others might emphasize the importance of high-volume transactions, speed, and efficiency, or they might be at the forefront of incorporating cutting-edge technology and data analytics to drive sales strategies. To truly resonate with your potential employer during the interview, it's imperative to conduct thorough research into the company's sales strategy, ethos, and how they perceive their relationship with clients. This research will enable you to craft responses that not only showcase your skills and experiences but also demonstrate how they align with the company's specific approach. Demonstrating this level of adaptability and alignment with the company's sales culture signals to your potential employer that you're not just a capable sales professional but also a seamless fit for their team. It shows that you're not only interested in the role but also committed to contributing to the company's success in a way that resonates with their values and objectives. 3. Showcase your soft skills In the realm of sales, especially within the nuanced and high-stakes environment of institutional investment sales, the importance of soft skills cannot be overstated. Emotional intelligence, communication prowess, adaptability, and problem-solving capabilities are not just nice-to-haves; they are essential tools that empower sales professionals to excel. These skills facilitate the navigation of complex negotiations, the forging and maintenance of robust customer relationships, and the ability to stay agile in the face of market volatility. When preparing for your job interview, reflect on your professional experiences to identify specific instances where these skills played a pivotal role. Perhaps you leveraged your emotional intelligence to salvage a potentially lost client relationship, or used your exceptional communication skills to simplify and sell a complex investment product. Maybe your adaptability allowed you to swiftly pivot strategies in response to market changes, leading to significant wins for your team. Through providing concrete examples of these soft skills in action, you underscore your holistic value as a sales professional. In a competitive job market, showcasing these soft skills can significantly differentiate you, illustrating that you possess both the technical acumen and the interpersonal finesse to thrive in a sales role. 4. Prepare for behavioral questions Behavioral questions are a staple of sales job interviews, as they allow interviewers to understand how you've handled real-world situations in the past. These questions often revolve around specific scenarios, such as managing a difficult customer interaction, surpassing ambitious sales targets, or fostering teamwork in high-stress situations. To effectively address these questions, familiarize yourself with the STAR method: Situation, Task, Action, Result. This structured approach encourages you to outline the context of the challenge (Situation), define your responsibilities (Task), describe the steps you took to address the challenge (Action), and conclude with the outcomes of your efforts (Result). Preparing your answers using this framework can significantly enhance the quality of your responses, making you a more compelling candidate by showcasing your capacity to handle the complex and dynamic challenges inherent in sales roles. 5. Ask insightful questions Asking insightful questions during a job interview is a powerful way to demonstrate your engagement, curiosity, and strategic thinking. It's essential to remember that an interview is indeed a two-way street; while the interviewer assesses your fit for the role, you are also evaluating the company's fit for your career aspirations. Preparing a list of thoughtful questions reflects your serious interest in the role and the company, and it can significantly influence the interviewer's perception of you as a candidate. These might include inquiries about the sales team's structure, the company's strategy for new market entry, or the biggest challenges facing the sales department. Asking about development opportunities and career progression can also underscore your long-term interest in the company. By asking these types of questions, you not only gather valuable information to help you decide if the company is the right fit for you, but you also position yourself as a thoughtful, proactive, and strategic candidate who is genuinely interested in making a meaningful contribution to the company. 6. Demonstrate your sales process Preparing to demonstrate your sales process in an interview is a proactive and impactful way to showcase your expertise and readiness for the role. This demonstration, whether it's through a brief presentation or a role-play exercise, offers a tangible glimpse into your approach to sales, from the initial prospecting phase through to the closing of a deal. It's an opportunity to not just tell but show how you navigate the sales cycle, apply strategic thinking, and utilize your communication skills to engage and persuade potential clients.

# article_007_why-401k-plans-are-the-next-big-opportunity-for-in

{'title': 'Why 401(k) Plans Are the Next Big Opportunity for Investment Sales in 2025', 'introduction': 'In the world of investment sales, growth is the name of the game Right now, defined contribution retirement plans, especially 401(k)s, are where the momentum is. While many sales teams zero in on institutional consultants, wirehouses, and RIAs, few have built a dedicated strategy around one of the largest and fastest-growing channels out there: the $12 trillion 401(k) market. If you’re distributing investment products and looking for scalable, long-term AUM, it’s time to start paying attention. As of Q1 2025, the U.S. retirement market has reached an estimated $43 trillion in total assets. Of that, defined contribution plans, primarily 401(k)s, account for $12.2 trillion ( source ). That’s nearly 30% of the entire retirement landscape. Today, there are over 715,000 active 401(k) plans supporting more than 70 million participants. And the market is only expanding, thanks in part to new state-run auto-enrollment programs that make retirement plans more accessible for small businesses and underserved populations. In this article we’ll discuss why 401(k) plans are becoming a hot topic for investment sales. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding. Underserved and Ripe with Opportunity Despite its scale, the 401(k) space remains surprisingly under-penetrated by investment sales teams. While many firms have well-defined approaches to RIAs or consultants, far fewer have invested in a true strategy for defined contribution plans. That’s a missed opportunity. Selling into 401(k)s is different. It’s complex, relationship-driven, and highly specialized. Success hinges on understanding the full ecosystem: plan sponsors, recordkeepers, retirement consultants, RIA aggregators, and increasingly, pooled employer plans (PEPs). The complexity is real, but so is the reward. There are fewer wholesalers in this space, which means less competition and more potential for sticky, recurring AUM. Get to Know the Vehicles: CITs Are Leading the Way Understanding who to call is only part of the puzzle. You also need to understand what’s being sold. Historically, mutual funds have dominated the 401(k) world, especially in small and mid-sized plans. But in recent years, Collective Investment Trusts (CITs) have taken center stage. These low-cost, flexible investment vehicles are now a top choice for large plan sponsors and institutional consultants looking to scale efficiently. As of early 2025, over $7 trillion in assets are held in CITs, up a staggering 65% from 2024. Even more notable: 84% of all 401(k) plans now offer CITs ( source ). If your firm isn’t distributing products through CITs, or at least thinking about it, it’s time to reassess your approach. Why 401(k) Plans Deserve a Spot in Your Sales Strategy There’s plenty of buzz in the market about alternatives, private wealth, and family offices. But let’s not overlook one of the most scalable, consistent, and growing asset channels out there. Here’s a snapshot of today’s defined contribution landscape: $12.2 trillion in DC plan assets 715,000+ active 401(k) plans 70+ million participants $7 trillion in CIT assets and rising This growth is fueled by legislation like SECURE Act 2.0, increased retirement access for small businesses, and a larger shift toward retirement readiness across the country. It’s a strategic market where few are selling, but many are buying. If you know the right players, and bring the right vehicles, you’re positioned to capture long-duration, scalable flows.

# article_249_dakota-marketplace-your-cost-benefit-breakdown

{'title': 'Dakota Marketplace: Your Cost-Benefit Breakdown', 'introduction': "Institutional databases come in a variety of functionalities and channel specialties, and, of course, a variety of costs. It can be overwhelming to decide how much you should spend, and harder to rationalize that cost to the leadership team at your firm. We know — we’ve been there too. Since 2006, the Dakota team has worked to raise over $30 billion for our clients, and we did it by spending long hours researching and compiling leads to find the right people to set meetings with. In 2018, we took that data and created Dakota Marketplace, our unique institutional investor database. Since then, hundreds of the leading investment firms have brought Marketplace into their offices to help make their lives easier and set more meetings. At Dakota, we like to be transparent about things like price up front, so that you know right off the bat if we’re in your price range and could be a potential fit. We know our value, and in this article, we’re going to break down the cost, features, and benefits of Dakota Marketplace, so you know exactly what makes it worth the investment. By the end of this article you will have a good sense of not just the actual price for Marketplace, but a better sense of the value it brings to your team that can’t be truly quantified. What is Dakota Marketplace? Dakota Marketplace is an institutional investor database that helps investment salespeople find and set meetings with the right prospects. Built by fundraisers for fundraisers, the Dakota team built Marketplace with investment salespeople in mind, meaning it has an intuitive, easy to use interface, is broken into easily navigable metro areas, and helps you focus on the firms that matter most to you. What do you get with Dakota Marketplace? Used by hundreds of investment firms, Marketplace's data is curated and qualified, so your sales team can focus on what matters most: selling to buyers that allocate to outside managers, not spending time researching who to call on. Here’s what you’ll have access to with a Dakota Marketplace subscription: Curated and up-to-date accounts and contacts Access a curated list of accounts and contacts that allocate to outside managers, broken down by channel and metro area. An outsourced database administration team With a team of four professional data experts and eight salespeople, the data within Marketplace is constantly being verified and updated, meaning you don’t have to chase down out of date contacts before starting outreach. Manager presentation decks Marketplace is home to more than one hundred manager presentation decks that you can view before you meet with someone. In Marketplace, you’ll have access to over 150 presentations given to public pension funds by other managers for insights into what other managers are saying and investing in. List building and custom reports These are two of the most-used features within Dakota Marketplace. This functionality allows you to create custom views and reports on exactly the firms, asset classes, and people you most want to do business with. Access to new searches Finding out about a new search early on can be critical, and our searches feature helps you make sure you’re never left in the dark when a new search is listed. With Dakota Searches, you can opt in to receive comprehensive institutional investment search alerts delivered directly to your inbox via email. Public plan minutes These minutes are compiled daily by our data team, and provide key insights from public pension committee meetings as they happen. You can opt in to receive daily reports of public pension investment committee meeting notes including recent hires, RFPs, portfolio allocation changes, and more, as well as access the complete library of past public plan minutes within Marketplace. Investment stats The investment statistics included in Dakota Marketplace make it easy to determine how you’re going to target accounts based on where they’ve allocated previously. Your team will be able to see a firm’s underlying investments, and then decide if they’re ready to reach out for a meeting. Conference and event information Dakota Marketplace is home to information on hundreds of upcoming investment industry conferences. Determine where you should be traveling, which events are worth your time, and more with this feature. Fee studies See what fees each public pension is paying their managers with fee structures tagged to public pension funds. Role changes We know that the investment industry moves fast. With people constantly moving firms and changing roles, it can be hard to track down the person you’re trying to reach out to. Marketplace’s job and role change feature helps you make sure that you’re always calling on the right person, in the right role, at the right place, without wasting any time on bad emails and contact information. Access to Dakota Live! Dakota Live! Is a bi-weekly premium webinar series that features a profile on a key account, exclusive insights from allocators, and metro area highlights from our team. You’ll also gain access to a library of all of our past calls from within Dakota Marketplace. How much does Dakota Marketplace cost? Price: $14,500 for one user, and $1,000 for every additional user license. What are current Marketplace users saying about the platform? “Dakota Marketplace has enhanced the capabilities of our Sales and Distribution team. Our team has been able to utilize all this data we previously didn’t have access to.” — Aileen McBride, Institutional Business Development, FS Investments “We have been satisfied with how Marketplace continues to evolve with the service we’ve received, and how accurate the information is.” — Louie Fetch, VP of Advisor Services, Clifford Capital “Marketplace has a broad (and expanding) data set that allows us to contact decision makers directly in order to do our jobs more effectively.” — Ehan Keator, Institutional Product Specialist, Davenport Asset Management “Marketplace has a great depth of content, but more importantly, it is kept current and accurate, leading to more valuable contact interactions. Further, the insight provided beyond simple contact details is invaluable to us. Dakota helps make our small team as efficient and capable as a much larger organization.” — Matthew Casara, CFA, Managing Partner, HGK Asset Management, Inc. Who is Dakota Marketplace right for? Dakota Marketplace is best for investment sales professionals working across all asset classes who want an all-in-one platform that helps make their days easier. Find out not just who to call on, but who and what they are already investing in, what they’re saying, and how they’ve allocated in the past. Why it’s worth the cost: efficiency and insights With Dakota Marketplace, you get access to over thousands of accounts and contacts. This data allows you to spend your valuable time setting and keeping meetings rather than searching for people to call on. Since the data is updated daily by a team of industry experts, you’ll never have to worry about logging in and finding the information you need missing or outdated. That means you can focus on connecting with your prospects. And, more than that, Marketplace gives you an edge by keeping you on top of the industry through additional platform content like the Dakota Live! Call, offering insights into key accounts and players. What is the standard price for an institutional investor database? We all hate hearing it, but it really depends. There are platforms like Preqin, which offers a variety of options, including Preqin Pro and Preqin Insights, and the price varies depending on the number and needs of the users. Similarly, FINTRX and FIN Searches are other institutional investor database platforms that offer a variety of subscription options, depending on the type of industry data you’re looking for. Typically, though, an institutional investor database could cost anywhere from $5,000 to $25,000. It all comes down to how your team plans to use the platform, and how many users you’ll be registering. Knowing the cost, how do you know if Dakota Marketplace is a good fit for you? If your sales team is spending more time finding people to call on than they are holding meetings, the answer is yes, Dakota Marketplace is a good fit for your firm. If you’re tired of logging into multiple platforms to get things done, set meetings, and do outreach, Dakota Marketplace would be a great solution. If you have a current database that is limited in size, scope, and features, switching to Dakota Marketplace could be the best use of your budget.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'Dakota Marketplace: Your Cost-Benefit Breakdown', 'content': "Institutional databases come in a variety of functionalities and channel specialties, and, of course, a variety of costs.

# article_361_8-things-every-investment-firms-tech-stack-should

{'title': "8 Things Every Investment Firm's Tech Stack Should Include", 'introduction': 'If you work at an investment firm, you know that every meeting matters. What you do before, during, and after those meetings matters, though, too. In fact, at Dakota, we like to think that it’s the follow up after a meeting that can make or break a relationship. Since 2006, the Dakota investment sales team has raised $40B for our partners, and in that time, have come to refine the tools that help us build relationships and set meetings. We talk a lot about how important email is in the sales process, but we also know that there’s a lot more to it than that. Analytics, relationship management, and marketing automation tools also play a huge role in our day to day sales and marketing efforts. In this article, we’re going to explore the eight things we think every firm can benefit from having in their tech stack. By the end of the article, you’ll know exactly where your firm can invest the time and money into building out your capabilities and enabling your sales team. 1. Salesforce From data integrity to better client service, a CRM like Salesforce can transform the way you do business every day, adding time back into your day and making meetings more productive. But most importantly, they give you clean and accurate data and a way to act on it. With over 150,000 customers around the world, and extremely customizable for the investment industry, Salesforce is one of the most widely-recognized CRM options available. There are countless use cases, customizations, and possibilities for you within their systems, and it can accommodate every team in your organization, from sales and marketing to IT.  This makes it a flexible solution built for scale. At Dakota, we use Salesforce to ensure that we are consistently following up after meetings, and we believe this has been instrumental in our success over the years. 2. Slack Slack is an instant messaging app that allows teams of every size to communicate, share updates, and in Dakota’s case, even log meeting notes. Because it can integrate with platforms like Salesforce, Google Suite, and others, nothing gets missed. Slack allows for your sales team to be in constant communication with other people in the firm, and ensures that they are as efficient as possible. 3. Hubspot With over 86,000 customers, Hubspot is a well-recognized CRM and inbound marketing solution. Hubspot offers a free option, which allows companies to get a sense of the product and what it can do, as well as more advanced, paid solutions. The software can help all aspects of your business to run more effectively, with platforms that help with everything from marketing and sales to customer service. Hubspot allows for website and content management, lead scoring, email marketing, and reporting that will help grow and track your pipeline. With Hubspot, you can empower your sales team through features like email sequencing, lead scoring, and data that enables them to make changes and optimizations to their outreach. 4. Neverbounce This software integrates with platforms like Hubspot and can run through full lists of contacts, delivering reports on all of your email addresses and determining whether they’re valid, invalid, or “catch all,” which means that no emails will be deliverable to that domain, even though you won’t get a bounceback. However, while Neverbounce helps you find out whether or not a contact is still at a particular firm, it will not tell you if they are still in the same position at said firm. If they’re not at the firm (the invlaid or catchall email addresses) you can send them for further evaluation. 5. Rocketreach and/or Seamless Two of the tools we use for further analysis of contacts that have already run through Neverbounce are Rocketreach and Seamless. These services will analyze data points like names and phone numbers to give you the person’s most up to date information. These tools also give you the ability to take the information they find and push it back into your Salesforce instance, instantly updating your data so that your sales team is equipped with accurate information when it comes time to reach out. Both of these services help streamline the data maintenance required by companies big and small, and help enable your sales team to stay focused on selling. However, it is important to note that while these services will begin the data maintenance process, there is a layer of human interference needed to upload that refreshed data into Salesforce, and to review the lists as they move through the process. 6. Linkedin sales navigator This tool can be used to find out if someone has changed jobs, and help you identify where they’ve gone. This, too, can be synchronized with your Salesforce instance so that you can instantly update your contact information. By uploading a full list of your accounts and contacts, Sales Navigator will notify you when anyone on that list has changed jobs or roles. Like Rocketreach and Seamless, Sales Navigator gives you the opportunity to review the change, and upload it directly into Salesforce. Knowing which job title someone has is important because if someone was once a hedge fund specialist, and is now a private equity specialist, you know the kind of emails they’ll benefit from receiving. This also allows you to maintain relationships as former clients move between firms, making it easier to close deals as they move around in their careers. 7. Gong This platform helps you break down any meeting by things like topics and speakers, and provides a transcript of the whole call that you can search through by keyword in order to follow up on specific things. It also allows teammates and supervisors to review calls and leave comments, which makes it a powerful tool for training and onboarding, especially as new people join the team. Rather than waiting and sitting in on five separate client calls, they can easily play through prior calls and determine the way the team speaks with clients and prospects, and can receive feedback after their own calls easily. Gong also breaks things down by user, so you can see everything from calls attended, calls listened, average speaking times, etc. This allows you to really hone in on the behavior of your team, and to drill down into calls and meetings to find out what works and what doesn’t. 8. Fellow Fellow is a great tool to use before and during meetings. It gives you the opportunity to enter an agenda, talking points, and notes, so that everyone on your team knows their role before the meeting happens. It helps keep everyone on the same page ahead of time, and allows the meeting to run as smoothly as possible once it starts. In addition to entering talking points and agenda, Fellow also enables your team to enter takeaways and next steps, so that follow up is never missed. You can also sync the application with your Google Calendar or Slack for an extra layer of accountability and transparency. Fellow is a great way to keep everyone on the same page and operating like a well-oiled machine. How to build out your firm’s tech stack We recommend that everyone starts out with a CRM, but where you go from there depends on your individual needs. If your team is struggling to communicate, Slack might be a natural next addition to your team. If you’re looking for ways to optimize email sends, a tool like RocketReach or Neverbounce could be for you. And finally, if you’re hoping to gain further insight into your marketing efforts, a platform like Hubspot could be a great investment.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': "8 Things Every Investment Firm's Tech Stack Should Include", 'content': 'If you work at an investment firm, you know that every meeting matters. What you do before, during, and after those meetings matters, though, too. In fact, at Dakota, we like to think that it’s the follow up after a meeting that can make or break a relationship. Since 2006, the Dakota investment sales team has raised $40B for our partners, and in that time, have come to refine the tools that help us build relationships and set meetings. We talk a lot about how important email is in the sales process, but we also know that there’s a lot more to it than that. Analytics, relationship management, and marketing automation tools also play a huge role in our day to day sales and marketing efforts. In this article, we’re going to explore the eight things we think every firm can benefit from having in their tech stack. By the end of the article, you’ll know exactly where your firm can invest the time and money into building out your capabilities and enabling your sales team. 1. Salesforce From data integrity to better client service, a CRM like Salesforce can transform the way you do business every day, adding time back into your day and making meetings more productive. But most importantly, they give you clean and accurate data and a way to act on it. With over 150,000 customers around the world, and extremely customizable for the investment industry, Salesforce is one of the most widely-recognized CRM options available. There are countless use cases, customizations, and possibilities for you within their systems, and it can accommodate every team in your organization, from sales and marketing to IT.  This makes it a flexible solution built for scale. At Dakota, we use Salesforce to ensure that we are consistently following up after meetings, and we believe this has been instrumental in our success over the years. 2. Slack Slack is an instant messaging app that allows teams of every size to communicate, share updates, and in Dakota’s case, even log meeting notes. Because it can integrate with platforms like Salesforce, Google Suite, and others, nothing gets missed. Slack allows for your sales team to be in constant communication with other people in the firm, and ensures that they are as efficient as possible. 3. Hubspot With over 86,000 customers, Hubspot is a well-recognized CRM and inbound marketing solution. Hubspot offers a free option, which allows companies to get a sense of the product and what it can do, as well as more advanced, paid solutions. The software can help all aspects of your business to run more effectively, with platforms that help with everything from marketing and sales to customer service. Hubspot allows for website and content management, lead scoring, email marketing, and reporting that will help grow and track your pipeline. With Hubspot, you can empower your sales team through features like email sequencing, lead scoring, and data that enables them to make changes and optimizations to their outreach. 4. Neverbounce This software integrates with platforms like Hubspot and can run through full lists of contacts, delivering reports on all of your email addresses and determining whether they’re valid, invalid, or “catch all,” which means that no emails will be deliverable to that domain, even though you won’t get a bounceback. However, while Neverbounce helps you find out whether or not a contact is still at a particular firm, it will not tell you if they are still in the same position at said firm. If they’re not at the firm (the invlaid or catchall email addresses) you can send them for further evaluation. 5. Rocketreach and/or Seamless Two of the tools we use for further analysis of contacts that have already run through Neverbounce are Rocketreach and Seamless. These services will analyze data points like names and phone numbers to give you the person’s most up to date information. These tools also give you the ability to take the information they find and push it back into your Salesforce instance, instantly updating your data so that your sales team is equipped with accurate information when it comes time to reach out. Both of these services help streamline the data maintenance required by companies big and small, and help enable your sales team to stay focused on selling. However, it is important to note that while these services will begin the data maintenance process, there is a layer of human interference needed to upload that refreshed data into Salesforce, and to review the lists as they move through the process. 6. Linkedin sales navigator This tool can be used to find out if someone has changed jobs, and help you identify where they’ve gone. This, too, can be synchronized with your Salesforce instance so that you can instantly update your contact information. By uploading a full list of your accounts and contacts, Sales Navigator will notify you when anyone on that list has changed jobs or roles. Like Rocketreach and Seamless, Sales Navigator gives you the opportunity to review the change, and upload it directly into Salesforce. Knowing which job title someone has is important because if someone was once a hedge fund specialist, and is now a private equity specialist, you know the kind of emails they’ll benefit from receiving. This also allows you to maintain relationships as former clients move between firms, making it easier to close deals as they move around in their careers. 7. Gong This platform helps you break down any meeting by things like topics and speakers, and provides a transcript of the whole call that you can search through by keyword in order to follow up on specific things. It also allows teammates and supervisors to review calls and leave comments, which makes it a powerful tool for training and onboarding, especially as new people join the team.

{'title': 'The Power of World-Class Networking Events: A Conversation with Gui Costin and Dustin Sullivan', 'introduction': 'In the investment management world, networking isn’t just an added bonus. It’s a critical component to success. Building and maintaining strong relationships with peers, clients, and potential partners can open doors to new opportunities, foster collaboration, and ultimately drive growth. But networking isn’t just about showing up; it’s about creating meaningful connections that can last a lifetime. Hosting and attending networking events are key strategies for thriving in the investment industry. These gatherings offer invaluable opportunities to share insights, exchange ideas, and build a trusted network. For this reason, at Dakota we have created a traveling series of events called Dakota Cocktails. At these events we bring together professionals in a relaxed setting where business relationships are forged, and partnerships are strengthened. We aim to find the new, trendy hot spots in large metro cities across the US and globally to bring industry professionals together. To delve deeper into the art of networking in the investment world, our CEO and founder Gui Costin sat down with Dustin Sullivan, Chief Revenue Officer at Havener Capital Partners, for a discussion on hosting world class events in the investment industry. In this conversation, they share their experiences, insights, and strategies for making the most of networking events. In this article, we are running through the Q and A session that resulted in this webinar on events. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding on hosting a world class networking event from the planning strategies to implement, who to invite, and a few ideas that hopefully inspire you! Q & A Session How often do you recommend hosting networking events? I\'m going to have a little fun with this answer. I strongly believe that you should commit to hosting events regularly and really develop your expertise in this area. Start by hosting one every quarter or every six months, and make it a priority. For example, say you\'re working with Edgewood Management, and you\'re planning their quarterly networking event at a fantastic venue. You’d frame it as an opportunity to come together, share ideas, and exchange leads. You might say, \'We can\'t wait to see you at XYZ bar, hotel, or restaurant!\' I’m so passionate about this because, surprisingly, not many people ask me about it. But the truth is, these events are incredibly effective and surprisingly easy to pull off. So yes, start with quarterly events, but commit to hosting at least eight over two years. As you continue, you\'ll start to see the same faces, and before you know it, you’ll become the central hub for connecting people in your industry. Do you ever co-host events with your investment management clients? We haven\'t co-hosted events with our investment management clients yet, but that\'s not to say we wouldn\'t consider it in the future. Our focus has always been on making these events about genuine networking, rather than spotlighting ourselves. If you\'ve ever attended a Dakota Cocktails event, you\'ve probably seen me making my rounds. I make it a point to personally greet every single person and thank them for coming. This approach allows me to get to know a lot of people quickly, and more importantly, it helps connect them with others—which is ultimately what they\'re there for. Do you have any advice for making Zoom events fun or making them stand out? We have clients globally, so it\'s hard to bring them together in-person. Given that our clients are spread across the globe, bringing them together in person isn’t always an option. During COVID, I participated in a virtual wine tasting organized by Salesforce, and it was an absolute blast—festive, fun, and memorable. For Zoom events, where networking is limited, I suggest focusing on a highly relevant and engaging topic. Choose something that’s current and interesting, and have your portfolio manager lead the discussion. The more compelling the topic, the better. Be sure to brand the event effectively. For example, you could say, \'Join us next Thursday from 4:00 to 4:45. Lately, we’ve been hearing a lot about X, Y, Z, and our ABC portfolio manager will be addressing three key questions around this topic.\' The key is to make it as engaging and substantial as possible so that attendees feel like it’s time well spent. Even if some clients can’t attend, the invitation itself serves as a valuable touchpoint. Many will request a replay to catch up on what was discussed, which extends the reach and impact of your event. For marketing in general, do you recommend going wide with many prospects, or just focus on a small number and try to go really deep? When it comes to event marketing, I recommend casting a wide net. You should send invitations to all allocators and everyone on your email list who plays a role in due diligence. The reason is simple: every business thrives on new opportunities. Finding the new is the lifeblood of any business. Imagine if a private equity firm spoke with a company that said, "We’re not focused on finding new customers; we’re just taking care of our existing ones." That conversation would likely end right there—no potential investment. For some reason, our industry can be hesitant to fully commit to this approach, but consistency and persistence in pursuing new prospects are crucial. You never know who might be interested or who might refer to someone else. There’s also the fact that about 25% of people will change jobs within a year. Someone who seems passive now might be in a more active role at a different firm later on. Staying in front of people and continually building your pool of qualified leads is critical. So yes, absolutely, send the invite to everyone. You never know where your next opportunity might come from. Do you have any goals or metrics of what you and your team are trying to get out of these events? Yes – our primary goal is to add value. You can’t always measure that directly, but by bringing people together, you’re creating opportunities for them to connect with industry colleagues. The appreciation we receive for simply hosting these events is incredible. So, first and foremost, our goal is to facilitate these connections without expecting anything in return. Beyond that, we aim to build deeper relationships. These events provide a unique opportunity for face-to-face interactions, not just for me, but for the entire team. Everyone gets involved in working the room, which helps us strengthen our network. In many ways, the benefits are immeasurable. As I say this, I’m struck by how underutilized this approach is. It’s one of the easiest and most rewarding things you can do. Outside of face-to-face meetings in a conference room, this is where the real magic happens. What we’ve noticed, especially when comparing Zoom to in-person meetings, is that face-to-face interactions drive so much more progress across the board in our industry. Are attendees reluctant to show up because they will get “sold” versus just showing up to network? This is exactly what I mean when I say, “Turn your brain off,” and I don’t mean that facetiously — I’m being completely serious. When it comes to customer acquisition, the key is that no one’s going to feel like they’re being ‘sold’ because you’re not there to sell them. What will actually happen is that attendees will leave thinking, “Wow, Bruce is fantastic. It was great to meet him — he wasn’t trying to push anything on me.” They understand the context; they know we’re all here to build relationships and potentially raise money. But if you genuinely show interest in them — their background, their family, their career — that sincerity can’t be faked, and it goes a long way. So no, attendees won’t be reluctant to show up if they sense that the event is about building connections rather than making a sales pitch. Bruce, you’re highlighting exactly why we’re having this conversation. Many people hesitate because they worry about how others will perceive their intentions. Trust me, I’m human too. Every time we send out an invitation, I wonder if people will think we’re just trying to sell them something. But that’s just noise in your brain. The key is to shut that down and just go for it. I hope that helps. Do you ever leave people with a swag bag or any other gift? And if so, what items do people enjoy receiving? If you\'ve worked with us before, you know we’re big on swag – we do a lot of it. As our events have grown, with over 100 attendees, managing swag has become more challenging. For local events, it’s easier, but overall, I don’t think it’s necessary. While you can certainly offer swag, it just adds complexity. Keeping it simple and reducing friction is often the best approach. Honestly, people don’t need the swag. I’m not often invited to incredible cocktail parties at amazing venues, but if I were in Philly and someone said, “Hey, we’re hosting an event at the Four Seasons for industry networking,” I’m there. And I’d encourage my colleagues to go too. When you offer a top-tier venue, great food, and drinks, with the chance to see industry colleagues, you become the event everyone wants to attend. On the flip side, I’ve seen competitors try to host events in their suburban corporate offices , so imagine a networking event in a second-story office building. That just doesn’t cut it. The venue matters. A world-class venue can double or even triple attendance. And if you think about it, all it takes is one person to allocate to one of your strategies over the next year, and the event is more than paid for. How often are you hosting events for prospects versus colleagues in the industry? Every event in our Dakota Cocktails series is designed to include both prospects and colleagues from the industry. However, if I were hosting an event specifically for due diligence analysts, I’d tailor the invite list accordingly. Due diligence analysts prefer to network with their peers, so for an event like that, I’d only invite them. They might be a bit cautious at first, but they’ll still attend—especially since there’s been a lot of interest in industry networking events exclusively for due diligence analysts. For broader events, like a quarterly gathering, you might consider something more inclusive, like a Christmas party, where you invite everyone. Those tend to attract a lot of allocators. So, we have two formats: For Dakota Cocktails, we invite everyone every time because it’s a broad, inclusive event. But if you’re concerned about whether due diligence analysts will feel overwhelmed by salespeople at a broader event, you might consider hosting something just for them. It’s all about tailoring the format to the audience and their networking preferences What about a budget for these events? I\'m thinking a budget in the range of two to three grand per event is a good starting point if you can manage it. The key is to gauge your expected attendance. We\'ve seen our numbers double and triple over the years, so it’s important to plan accordingly. For example, you might start with a plan to host two events a year specifically for due diligence analysts to network. Each of these could be in that two to three grand range. I also suggest inviting a broader audience to see what kind of ROI you get. If you focus solely on due diligence analysts, you’re likely to see the highest ROI because they’re directly relevant to your goals. On the other hand, inviting other fundraisers might not benefit an investment firm as much since it’s less about raising money and more about networking within the industry. Most of us already have our own networks for that. If you want to think smaller, you could strategize around a micro event, say, inviting 20 people for a cocktail party. You could market it as a free event centered on the challenges of fundraising, given the lack of great conferences. It would be a chance to share leads, build relationships, and set up follow-up meetings. This kind of intimate, targeted event is one of the most effective ways to connect with new investors. Dakota Cocktails Dakota Cocktails is a premier networking event series hosted by Dakota, designed to bring together asset managers, allocators, and industry professionals in a relaxed, engaging atmosphere. These events are held at trendy, upscale venues across major cities in the U.S. and internationally, offering attendees a unique opportunity to forge meaningful business connections. With a focus on creating a vibrant, community-oriented experience, Dakota Cocktails has become a go-to event for professionals looking to expand their networks and explore new opportunities in the investment world.

{'title': 'Q2 13F ETF Flow Comparison By Sub-Asset Class', 'introduction': 'During Q2 the 13-F trends we saw from an asset class/sub asset class level were contrary to what the headline news would have led us to believed. Even with the volatility the fact that equities in general maintained over 50% share of ETF flows was impressive and within equities, value bent equities were favored. Fixed income showed the largest gain as rising yields made the asset class attractive again for allocators, more specifically ultra-short/short duration is where we saw the highest sub-asset class flows. Where did we see a large decrease? Commodities by far showed the largest reversal quarter over quarter as some of the Russia/Ukraine headlines fell off bringing agriculture prices down.

{'title': 'The 10 Best CRMs for Investment Firms to Consider in 2025', 'introduction': 'CRMs are the backbone of any investment firm. In fact, at Dakota we like to say, “If it’s not in the CRM, it didn’t happen.” A well-managed CRM does more than just store data – it enhances data integrity, improves client service, adds time back into your day, and makes meetings more productive.

With data quality in mind, we’ve compiled a list of the 10 best CRMs for 2025. Some are general platforms, while others are purpose-built for investment firms.

{'title': 'The 3 Key Benefits of Joining the Dakota Live! Call', 'introduction': "If you’re an investment salesperson, you likely have one primary goal: finding the right people to call on so that you can raise more capital. We know because we’re out there doing this too. We know that it can feel like every few weeks or months, you’re hitting a wall. The Dakota team has been raising capital since 2006, and in that time, we’ve raised over $35B. We did it through countless hours of research. We spent a ton of time figuring out exactly who to call on, when to call them, and for what purpose. We did it by talking to people in the industry, making connections, and maintaining those relationships over time. For a while, this was our “secret sauce.” But starting in 2018, we decided we wanted to share it. Enter, the Dakota Live! Call: a premier, bi-weekly event that highlights industry news, profiles key accounts, and helps investment sales people connect with each other virtually. Dakota Live! brings to life that same spirit of relationship building and information sharing that has helped us be successful for fifteen years. In this article, we’ll outline exactly what Dakota Live! Call is and who it’s for, as well as the benefits of joining each week. By the end of the article, you’ll have an understanding of what makes Dakota Live! so unique, and how it can save your team time and effort researching who to call on. What is the Dakota Live! Call? We touched on it briefly above, but The Dakota Live! Call is a premier, bi-weekly event for Dakota Members, hosted by Dakota’s own fundraising team. Each call provides deep insight into institutional investment allocators — who they are, what they think, what they’re investing in, and details about their investment platform. In short, the call covers everything an institutional investment sales professional would want to know about an allocator before meeting with them. Each call contains 100% original content obtained and presented by our own investment sales team, and includes four key things: Interview with a leading Allocator (CIO, Director of Research) A profile of the Institutional Investors in a city (Boston, NYC) A deep analysis of two key Accounts An overview of call notes, searches, personnel changes, and new RIAs found Now that you know exactly what the call is, we’ll dive into some of the benefits it provides. Why should I join the call? 1. Gain a complete overview of a new metro area each week The Dakota Live! call provides an overview of a city each week. One of the benefits is learning about potential investors that you might not have known about. The Metro Area portion of the call reviews an entire city and its surrounding area, covering every major metro area from New York to San Francisco. This helps investment sales professionals not only find new accounts that they may not have been aware of, but helps plan out meetings when you’re traveling to one of those cities again. You can cut down research and planning time, giving you hours back in your day to set and hold meetings rather than search for people to call. 2. Gather insight into key accounts and allocator profiles Each week, we do a complete breakdown of two key accounts that provides you with the information and insight you need to properly navigate that account. This section saves you a lot of time and energy in the process, removing the administrative and research efforts that go into learning about an account. Additionally, each week our Chief Investment Officer, Chris O’Grady, hosts a live interview with an investment allocator. This interview covers everything from how they think and invest to the details of their platform and how to access it. Since the start of the call, we’ve hosted over one hundred of these allocator interviews, which Dakota Marketplace members can access through the Marketplace platform. Dakota Marketplace is a database solution for investment salespeople, designed to help cut down research time, and provide you with constantly updated accounts and contacts to call on. 3. Access the pre- and post-call notes Finally, by dialing into the call, you’ll get access to our pre- and post-call meeting notes. These notes are a summation of calls and in-person meetings that the Dakota team is part of on a weekly basis. They include insights from different allocators and what they’re looking for currently, what searches they have currently. These post call documents compile notes from our own sales meetings and share them with a wider audience, allowing you to access new information and increase your outreach without needing to schedule more meetings. Ready to see what it's all about? The Dakota Live! Call helps you gather new information and access to new leads, and helps you to keep your finger on the pulse of the industry without setting up countless meetings to do so. And while it seems simple, at Dakota, we believe that even though we can provide an overview of what each call will cover, you can't truly understand it until you experience it yourself. So, now that you know what goes into each bi-weekly Dakota Live! Call, it’s time to dive in. Register for the next Dakota Live! Call and see for yourself the information you can learn and time you will save by attending a truly unique and collaborative industry call.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'The 3 Key Benefits of Joining the Dakota Live!

# article_311_the-top-10-owners-of-commodities-etfs-in-2022

{'title': 'The Top 10 Owners of Commodities ETFs in 2022', 'introduction': '“The cheapest time to buy insurance is when you don’t need it.” With inflation surging globally, commodities and their impact on the globe have been brought into the spotlight by the onset of Russia’s invasion into Ukraine. Consumers are seeing these impacts daily, as are many companies with their profits being impacted by higher input costs for the foreseeable future. From an investment perspective, while we cannot plan for each tail event, we can certainly construct portfolios that build in natural airbags via proper diversification that can help buffer against these shocks. Commodities are one of those assets and are broken down into four basic sub asset classes: Metals, Energy, Livestock and Meat, and Agriculture. Prior to the Ukraine/Russia engagement, commodities, similar to the regular business cycle, were experiencing a V-shaped recovery due to the vaccine and fiscal stimulus driving the recovery. However, unlike the business cycle where you can simply hire people or buy additional equipment, commodities were not prepared for this recovery.  Much of this was in motion pre-pandemic. As the greening of the globe has gained traction over the past decade, ESG investing has drawn capital away from the old economy and the production of “when you drop it on your foot it hurts,” has not kept up with rebounding demand. We have witnessed this as investment flows on an individual and institutional level have gone toward ESG related investment, and away from — even banning —non-ESG aligned investments. The problem is, we still have to eat, drive, fly, build, feed, heat our homes, etc. These are all building blocks of the industrial world. We are now witnessing what occurs when you under-invest, the supply has not increased, yet you have demand that is constant, stimulated and increasing.…prices go up, we have diminished purchasing power in our wallets and corporate profits are exposed. What is an investor to do? In the never-ending quest to improve the risk and return characteristics of our portfolios, we are always searching for new assets that are not perfectly correlated with the assets that we already own. When many investors construct an investment portfolio, the building blocks are often the “60/40” blend of stocks and bonds. For more than 10 years, low interest rates and central bank buying created a positive environment for both asset classes. As all good things must come to an end, and central banks look to normalize their monetary involvement, asset classes will and have been reacting. As of the end of Q1 2022, the S&P 500 was down -4.6%, the Barclays Aggregate Bond Index down -5.86%, with a blended return of -5% for the quarter. Concurrently, the S&P GSCI Commodity index was up 33% for the quarter, exhibiting the non-correlated nature of the asset class. small free trial banner The benefits of adding commodities as part of portfolio construction boil down to: Inflation hedging, without the duration of fixed income Positive correlation with inflation Diversification away from equity and traditional business cycle risk Commodities have shown to improve expected risk-adjusted returns in a multi-asset portfolio As with equities and fixed income, many avenues can be taken to gain exposure to commodities. Ranging from physical ownership of a mine or farm, to investment vehicles such as passive indices and active approaches via ETFs and mutual funds. Some benefits of a passive approach to commodities may include: Scalability and liquidity, a passive approach is not capacity constrained as some active approaches can be Costs, transaction, and exposure costs are minimal in order gain exposure to the underlying index/market Simple vehicle for a diversified basket of broad basket commodity exposure, specifically when the investor has macro point of view that encompasses a broad basket While the benefits of an active approach may include: Passive index investors bear the burden of understanding how the actual index selection can impact their performance or intended exposure VS an active manager can make this part of their investment process. An example of this is the SP GSCI index has 50% in energy, while the Bloomberg Commodity index has 33% in energy. Take advantage of commodity specific characteristics as a source of alpha, such as backwardation and contango and use stops, short specific sub-sectors, and rebalance constantly Active approaches can express exposures based on macro-economic views.  An example would be the last commodity cycle was driven by the build out of many developing countries such as China, requiring base metals VS the current environment where precious metals used for electric vehicle batteries will be sought.

{'title': 'Top 10 RIAs in the Milwaukee Metro Area', 'introduction': "If you're in investment sales, you likely already know that one of the biggest problems of selling to the RIA (Registered Investment Adviser) marketplace is the sheer size of it. The RIA market across the United States consists of over 36,000 firms, which means that while there are plenty to choose from when looking for new clients, narrowing down the list to only those that allocate to outside managers is going to be key. Here at Dakota, we’ve raised over $6 billion from over 350 RIAs, and that has been possible because we qualify and curate our list to only RIAs that allocate to outside managers.

# article_100_the-growth-of-family-offices

{'title': 'The Growth of Family Offices', 'introduction': 'Over the past several years, the landscape of family office investing has undergone a significant transformation, reshaping the way wealth is managed and preserved across generations. What was once a relatively niche segment within the financial industry has rapidly expanded, with family offices growing not only in number but also in their influence on global markets. These private wealth management firms, often established by ultra-wealthy families, have become key players in the investment space, driving trends and influencing financial strategies on a broad scale. In this article, we are highlighting how the family office market has seen transformative growth over the past 10+ years, and the implications of this growth. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of family offices and why many firms are swaying towards them. What are Family Offices? Family offices are private wealth management firms established by wealthy families to manage their financial affairs. They handle a wide range of services, including investment management, estate planning, tax services, and philanthropy. Family offices can be single-family offices (SFOs), serving one family, or multi-family offices (MFOs), serving multiple families. There are other entities like Private Banks and Wealth Management firms that provide financial services to wealthy individuals, and tend to be a part of larger financial institutions. While the offerings and capabilities of these types of firms differ, they all exist to preserve and grow the wealth of their clients. What is the cause of their growth? More wealthy people than ever Analyzing the growth of family offices starts with understanding the size of the pool of high net worth individuals (HNWI). These people have a net worth of over $1 million, and if you have over $30 million to your name, you are considered an ultra-high net worth individual (UHNWI). In 2004, there were roughly 157,000 HNWI that held 9.6% of global wealth. As of 2022, that number has almost doubled to 295,000 that hold 10.6% of global wealth (JPM FO Report 2024). JPMorgan estimates that by 2027, the amount of HNWI’s will surpass 500,000 and control over 11% of global wealth. As the amount of wealthy individuals increases, the need and demand for bespoke financial services via family offices will grow. The Great Wealth Transfer Another driver of family office growth is The Great Wealth Transfer. As Baby Boomers pass on their accumulated wealth to their inheritors, a massive shift of wealth involving trillions of dollars will take place, the need for family office services will be in high demand. According to the Family Office World Newsletter, this will be the most significant wealth transfer in history, with an estimated $84.4 trillion being transferred over the next two decade (link). When significant amounts of wealth change hands, individuals will seek advice on how to preserve and grow these assets, as well as estate planning, tax advice, and much more. Desire for a more personalized experience As managing money becomes increasingly complex, and the needs of HNWI’s are becoming more and more diverse, wealthy families are seeking more sophisticated advice beyond traditional wealth management services and asset classes. The personalized wealth management solutions that family offices offer allow wealthy families to get individualized attention that will be in higher demand as this group of people accumulate more assets over time.

What was once a relatively niche segment within the financial industry has rapidly expanded, with family offices growing not only in number but also in their influence on global markets. These private wealth management firms, often established by ultra-wealthy families, have become key players in the investment space, driving trends and influencing financial strategies on a broad scale.

By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of family offices and why many firms are swaying towards them. What are Family Offices? Family offices are private wealth management firms established by wealthy families to manage their financial affairs. They handle a wide range of services, including investment management, estate planning, tax services, and philanthropy. Family offices can be single-family offices (SFOs), serving one family, or multi-family offices (MFOs), serving multiple families.

# article_316_how-to-sync-your-google-calendar-with-salesforce

{'title': 'How to Sync Your Google Calendar With Salesforce', 'introduction': 'When you’re setting up meetings and booking calls, the last thing you want to do is add the same meeting to five different platforms. But, you also don’t want to miss entering those meetings on your calendar or in Salesforce and lose track of them later. To eliminate the double entry of meetings, Salesforce allows its users to sync their Google Calendars with their Salesforce instance. This takes away some of the friction when it comes to entering meetings, and ensures that you’re not missing any crucial meetings on either platform. At Dakota, entering meetings and meeting notes in Salesforce is something that is part of our sales team’s DNA, and we believe it’s critical to enter accurate, reliable meeting information in order to do follow-up effectively. We’ve been using Salesforce as our CRM to do just this since 2006, and have raised over $40 billion in that time. In this article, we’re sharing how you can sync your Gmail calendar with Salesforce to increase your team’s efficiency and create a follow-up system. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear idea of how to get started. First, we’ll dive into why syncing between your calendar and Salesforce matters. The cost of meeting double-entry We all know that there are so many hours in the day, and if you’re having your sales team spend their time entering meetings and meeting details across multiple platforms, chances are, they’re missing out on doing much more productive activities. Syncing meetings across platforms allows for three key things: 1. Salespeople can stay focused on selling. Did you know that salespeople spend over half of their day doing activities that aren’t selling? Things like data and meeting entry are some of the tasks that take them away from what they should be doing, which is setting and holding meetings. 2. Eliminate errors and bad data. Having people enter meetings again and again only increases the likelihood of a date being entered incorrectly, a name getting spelled wrong, or someone being left off the invitation list. Syncing meetings removes the human error factor and ensures nothing gets missed. 3. Increased CRM adoption. We’ve said it time and again, but the number one reason your sales team doesn’t want to use their CRM is because the data inside of it is bad, outdated, or incomplete. If they know that good, accurate data is getting put into the CRM (and even better — getting put in automatically), they’re far more likely to fully adopt the CRM in the end. Next we’ll outline the three simple steps to setting up the sync between your Google Calendar and Salesforce. How to sync your Google Calendar with Salesforce The sync between your inbox and your Salesforce instance can be done using Salesforce’s Einstein Activity Capture feature.

But, you also don’t want to miss entering those meetings on your calendar or in Salesforce and lose track of them later. To eliminate the double entry of meetings, Salesforce allows its users to sync their Google Calendars with their Salesforce instance. This takes away some of the friction when it comes to entering meetings, and ensures that you’re not missing any crucial meetings on either platform. At Dakota, entering meetings and meeting notes in Salesforce is something that is part of our sales team’s DNA, and we believe it’s critical to enter accurate, reliable meeting information in order to do follow-up effectively. We’ve been using Salesforce as our CRM to do just this since 2006, and have raised over $40 billion in that time. In this article, we’re sharing how you can sync your Gmail calendar with Salesforce to increase your team’s efficiency and create a follow-up system. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear idea of how to get started. First, we’ll dive into why syncing between your calendar and Salesforce matters. The cost of meeting double-entry We all know that there are so many hours in the day, and if you’re having your sales team spend their time entering meetings and meeting details across multiple platforms, chances are, they’re missing out on doing much more productive activities. Syncing meetings across platforms allows for three key things: 1. Salespeople can stay focused on selling. Did you know that salespeople spend over half of their day doing activities that aren’t selling? Things like data and meeting entry are some of the tasks that take them away from what they should be doing, which is setting and holding meetings. 2. Eliminate errors and bad data. Having people enter meetings again and again only increases the likelihood of a date being entered incorrectly, a name getting spelled wrong, or someone being left off the invitation list. Syncing meetings removes the human error factor and ensures nothing gets missed. 3. Increased CRM adoption. We’ve said it time and again, but the number one reason your sales team doesn’t want to use their CRM is because the data inside of it is bad, outdated, or incomplete. If they know that good, accurate data is getting put into the CRM (and even better — getting put in automatically), they’re far more likely to fully adopt the CRM in the end. Next we’ll outline the three simple steps to setting up the sync between your Google Calendar and Salesforce. How to sync your Google Calendar with Salesforce The sync between your inbox and your Salesforce instance can be done using Salesforce’s Einstein Activity Capture feature. Einstein Activity Capture allows both admins and users to enable a sync between both Google and Outlook Calendars and Salesforce in just three steps. 1. From your personal settings, enter Connected Accounts in the Quick Find box, and then select Email and Calendar Accounts. If your admin connected an account for you, it will be listed under Connected Accounts. If it’s not, try refreshing the page. 2. Click New Account. 3. Follow the steps to connect your account. After you connect an account, it takes up to 24 hours for Einstein Activity Capture to add your emails and events to related Salesforce records, but Inbox features are available right away.', 'bullet_points': [], 'subsections': []}], 'key_takeaways': [], 'faqs': []}

# article_301_the-top-10-holders-of-energy-etfs-in-2022

{'title': 'The Top 10 Holders of Energy ETFs in 2022', 'introduction': 'It was not that long ago in April 2020 when US crude oil had gone negative ( below $0) as the Covid shutdown caused us to run out of physical places to store crude. It became the “hot potato” of the commodity sector. While the globe flipped short term consumption into the “ off “ position, it was not as easy to do in capital and labor intensive industries such as oil and natural gas. Prior to the pandemic, the sector was already experiencing an evacuation of both financial and physical investment due to the ESG/Carbon Zero movements underway and the desire of capital sources to reduce their exposure to the industry in its entirety. We saw this reflected not just via 13F ETF flows, but also via the Public Pension Plan minutes which Dakota provides in Marketplace. Many pension, endowments, and foundations had made it clear that they were pulling investment allocations completely away from fossil fuels moving forward. By November of 2020, the energy sector had sunk to below 2% of the entire S&P 500 on a market cap basis. To put this in perspective, over the past 40 years, energy stocks went from 30% to less than 3% of the S&P 500, and now make up none of the top 10 biggest stocks. During the  2010s, the sector rose just 3.3% per year from 2010-2019 versus 13.4% annual returns for the overall S&P 500. All of this led to energy having the worst price performance versus the SP 500 since the Great Depression and having a weighting smaller than Apple. (source : Bespoke Investments) Once the vaccines were released, particularly in the US, where there was a robust rollout program, many realized that we did in fact need diesel, jet fuel, natural gas and other forms of fossil fuels for the world to operate and re-open. Yet, the industry had suffered from under-investment and human capital for over a year now as many viewed investment in fossil fuels as socially unacceptable. In mid-2021, the demand for oil, gas, and natural gas by-products had already reached pre-Covid levels, yet OPEC was already pumping at 2019 levels with very little to no spare capacity. Over the past three quarters now, as energy companies reap the benefit of spiraling oil and natural gas prices, the energy sector is catching up again and flows have followed with energy being the unloved to being on the world stage. Q3 2021: Last year we saw a muted 2% gain, as concerns about global growth, COVID, etc. continued and did not see many commitments in filings. Q4 2021: Vaccine usage increased, and investors began to realize how cheap the sector had gotten, resulting in a 7% increase in flows via filings. Q1 2022: A massive 48% in sector flows was accelerated by the Ukrainian-Russian conflict among allocators who filed. Looking under the hood, the last two quarters have shown a preference towards exploration, production, and drilling focused ETFs and closed end funds. Allocators are looking for operating and earnings leverage from these companies being so lean right now and that they have pricing power.  MLPs have participated in an increase as well, but much less due to their role in the sector. While the sector is in favor today, we have seen boom and bust cycles in energy before and ESG trends will continue as many countries strive to get to Net Zero in carbon emissions. Some additional things to consider include: ESG focus has led to an evacuation of capital and caused energy capex to drop 30% from pre covid levels and 50% from 2014 levels. CapEx for renewable energy is now twice that of oil and gas. Currently solar and wind represent 2% of energy output, compared to fossil fuels at 80%. This is a sobering reminder that the transition to ESG energy will take time and large investment. Oil Rig count was at 800 in Jan 2019, now only 750 rigs in operation despite energy demand rebounding and exceeding where we were pre-COVID. With Russian oil banned for the foreseeable future, the energy industry needs to come up with an additional 38 million barrels per day to fill this void.

{'title': 'The Top 10 Largest Public Pension Allocations to Private Equity of 2021', 'introduction': 'Staying up-to-date on where public pension funds are making their investments can be a critical part of an investment salesperson’s day to day. However, it can also be an incredibly time consuming task, given the sheer number of pension funds across the country. At Dakota, we’ve been fundraising since 2006, and have raised over $40B for our partners in that time. We’ve made it part of our DNA to stay on top of public pension fund investments, and we want to help make these updates as accessible to our peers as possible. In this article, we’re going to dive into ten of the largest public pension allocations made to private equity so far this year. By the end of this list, you’ll have a good jumping off point to better understand where funds are being allocated within the Private Equity space. 1.

{'title': 'May 2024 Financial Advisor and RIA Moves and Acquisitions', 'introduction': 'In May 2024, Dakota tracked significant activity in the financial advisor and RIA industry, driven by increased demand for personalized financial planning. LPL Financial led in transaction volume, leveraging its expansive network and technology. Merrill Lynch and UBS also saw significant activity, thanks to their global reach. Rockefeller Capital Management and Wealth Enhancement Group had fewer transactions, focusing on targeted acquisitions and organic growth. Raymond James maintained steady performance with a balanced approach. One of the larger acquisitions this month, Focus Financial Partners affiliates Buckingham Wealth Partners and The Colony Group have reached an agreement to merge, creating a combined entity that will manage $115 billion in assets under management as both a wealth manager and investment outsourcing firm. Adam Birenbaum, CEO of Buckingham, will lead the new combined entity, while Michael Nathanson will continue as the CEO of Focus Financial.

This merger will create a substantial Registered Investment Advisor, combining nearly 1,200 employees and over 90 offices, serving tens of thousands of clients and enhancing client and advisor opportunities by leveraging the firms\' complementary services and extensive capabilities.

# article_039_january-2025-financial-advisor-moves-and-ria-acqui

{'title': 'January 2025 Financial Advisor Moves and RIA Acquisitions', 'introduction': "The new year got off to a strong start in January, continuing last quarter’s momentum, especially when it came to RIA M&A deals, while private equity investment activity in the space picked up and independent advisors continued to move at a brisk pace. On the M&A front, Dakota tracked a record 43 deal announcements representing approximately $338.3B in client assets, eclipsing October’s then-record 37 deal announcements involving $255B in managed assets. The month’s tally could be a little misleading though, as Mariner’s acquisition of Cardinal Point accounted for $292B – or 86% – of the total. It was a busy month for Mariner, which also acquired three other firms – Cassady Schiller Wealth , Jenkins Wealth , and Triton Financial Group – that added a further $1.1B to its AUA. Outside of Mariner, Corient Private Wealth would have had the largest deal of January with its acquisition of $10.4B New York-based multifamily office Geller MFO , following closely on its December acquisition of $7.9B RIA H.M. Payson , which was the largest M&A deal that month. Among the other more notable deals in the month, Midwest RIAs Vision Financial Group , Business & Financial Strategies , and Clevenger Financial merged to form Financial Integrators , pooling together $2B in client assets, while private equity-backed Homrich Berg finalized its acquisition of $6B WMS Partners, which was announced in December (and not included in this month’s deal announcement totals). RIA investments also ticked higher in January, with Dakota tracking seven deal announcements: Z2 , Hamilton Lane , and Everside Capital investing in Long Island RIA Coastline Wealth Constellation Wealth buying a stake in $3B NoVa RIA Bogart Wealth Elevation Point staking $750M Michigan RIA Stonebrook Private FJM acquiring a 20% stake in $4.7B Atlanta UHNW RIA Balentine OneDigital staking $5B Canadian wealth manager PWL Capital Wealth Partners and Aspire Holdings investing in $2B NY RIA Wealth Alliance Summit Financial and Merchant Investment Management partnering on an investment in $700M Missouri RIA Genex Consulting That heightened pace could be set to continue, as Los Angeles-based RIAs Lido Advisors and Evoke Advisors , as well as Commonwealth Financial Network and Audax Group , are all reportedly in the market shopping minority equity stakes to further their growth. Consulting powerhouse McKinsey & Co. is also reportedly considering a spin off or sale of its $23B in-house RIA MIO Partners . In terms of independent advisor moves, LPL led the way in volume, recruiting seven teams managing a combined $4.1B in client assets, most notably $1.3B New Jersey-based Bruen Wealth Management from UBS and $1B RIA Salient Wealth of California from Osaic. Meanwhile, Dynasty Financial made some of the more notable moves in the month, landing $6.4B SageSpring Wealth Partners from Raymond James and a $1.6B team in Washington, DC, from Goldman Sachs . Other noteworthy developments in January included the launch of new RIAs Wolf Pine Capital in Portsmouth, NH, Bridge Generations Wealth Management in Miami and Salt Lake City, and K2 Wealth Management in Chicago. Pegula family-backed Bison Holdings combined its wealth management and advisory divisions to establish Bison Wealth , Orange County Bancorp launched Orange Wealth Management , and the Pepin family of Tampa launched the Pepin Family Office .

Report: Audax Group Mulls", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'January 2025 Financial Advisor Moves and RIA Acquisitions', 'content': "The new year got off to a strong start in January, continuing last quarter’s momentum, especially when it came to RIA M&A deals, while private equity investment activity in the space picked up and independent advisors continued to move at a brisk pace. On the M&A front, Dakota tracked a record 43 deal announcements representing approximately $338.3B in client assets, eclipsing October’s then-record 37 deal announcements involving $255B in managed assets. The month’s tally could be a little misleading though, as Mariner’s acquisition of Cardinal Point accounted for $292B – or 86% – of the total. It was a busy month for Mariner, which also acquired three other firms – Cassady Schiller Wealth , Jenkins Wealth , and Triton Financial Group – that added a further $1.1B to its AUA. Outside of Mariner, Corient Private Wealth would have had the largest deal of January with its acquisition of $10.4B New York-based multifamily office Geller MFO , following closely on its December acquisition of $7.9B RIA H.M. Payson , which was the largest M&A deal that month. Among the other more notable deals in the month, Midwest RIAs Vision Financial Group , Business & Financial Strategies , and Clevenger Financial merged to form Financial Integrators , pooling together $2B in client assets, while private equity-backed Homrich Berg finalized its acquisition of $6B WMS Partners, which was announced in December (and not included in this month’s deal announcement totals). RIA investments also ticked higher in January, with Dakota tracking seven deal announcements: Z2 , Hamilton Lane , and Everside Capital investing in Long Island RIA Coastline Wealth Constellation Wealth buying a stake in $3B NoVa RIA Bogart Wealth Elevation Point staking $750M Michigan RIA Stonebrook Private FJM acquiring a 20% stake in $4.7B Atlanta UHNW RIA Balentine OneDigital staking $5B Canadian wealth manager PWL Capital Wealth Partners and Aspire Holdings investing in $2B NY RIA Wealth Alliance Summit Financial and Merchant Investment Management partnering on an investment in $700M Missouri RIA Genex Consulting That heightened pace could be set to continue, as Los Angeles-based RIAs Lido Advisors and Evoke Advisors , as well as Commonwealth Financial Network and Audax Group , are all reportedly in the market shopping minority equity stakes to further their growth. Consulting powerhouse McKinsey & Co. is also reportedly considering a spin off or sale of its $23B in-house RIA MIO Partners . In terms of independent advisor moves, LPL led the way in volume, recruiting seven teams managing a combined $4.1B in client assets, most notably $1.3B New Jersey-based Bruen Wealth Management from UBS and $1B RIA Salient Wealth of California from Osaic. Meanwhile, Dynasty Financial made some of the more notable moves in the month, landing $6.4B SageSpring Wealth Partners from Raymond James and a $1.6B team in Washington, DC, from Goldman Sachs . Other noteworthy developments in January included the launch of new RIAs Wolf Pine Capital in Portsmouth, NH, Bridge Generations Wealth Management in Miami and Salt Lake City, and K2 Wealth Management in Chicago. Pegula family-backed Bison Holdings combined its wealth management and advisory divisions to establish Bison Wealth , Orange County Bancorp launched Orange Wealth Management , and the Pepin family of Tampa launched the Pepin Family Office .
