{'title': 'Creating a Repeatable, Successful Sales Process: Principle 1 - Focus on What Matters Most', 'introduction': "In the dynamic world of sales, success hinges on more than just ambition and persistence; it requires creating a repeatable sales process. We understand the intricacies of this challenging field - marked by emotional ups and downs, extended sales cycles, and frequent rejections. At Dakota, we’ve created this repeatable process for our investment sales team. Our four core principles have led us to success, and provided 20 years of results. We review these principles monthly in our Rainmaker sessions with Gui Costin. This is a class for any investment sales professional as it lays out the blueprint for a winning sales strategy. No matter the experience level - wanting to touch up, wanting to learn tips and tricks, or new to fundraising - Rainmaker is a sales training program with proven results. In this article are diving into principle one to creating a repeatable sales process: focus on what matters most. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of the two things you’ll need to do in order to achieve this and how they'll help you reach your fundraising goals. To learn more about our four principles to sales, check out an upcoming Rainmaker Live! session with Gui Costin. Principle 1: focus on what matters most Sales is an arena filled with challenges - long cycles, frequent rejections, and intense competition. To navigate this landscape successfully, it's essential to first embrace this challenge. Next, you need to have a clear and focused strategy - which is why our first principle is to focus on what matters most. This principle is about hyper-focusing on the things you can control, and chipping away at them one at a time as you work to meet your goals. So, how do you know what your goals are? Let’s get into it. Set expectations The first thing you’re going to want to do is create alignment between you and upper management, or your boss. This is to create complete transparency in order to know your goals. Sit down and outline expectations so you have something to work towards. Every month you should review these with your boss to ensure they know what you're working on. There's nothing worse than when your boss is out of the loop on what you're working on. Create a sales plan After setting expectations, this will help you make your sales plan. The purpose of your unique sales plan is for you to come in everyday and have an outline for what you're going to do. You should never be questioning what it is you're doing. Your sales plan should align with your goals and the unique demands of your market. While your plan is more than just a set of goals, it's your comprehensive approach that includes understanding your total addressable market (TAM) and planning your sales activities. Knowing your audience and their needs helps in creating your sales plan, ensuring that your efforts are focused and impactful. The plan should cover: Total Addressable Market (TAM): Knowing your audience is crucial. Who are your ideal customers? What are their needs and how does your product meet them? This clarity enables you to focus your efforts where they matter the most. Value Proposition: What sets your product apart? Your sales plan should articulate the unique benefits your product offers, tailored to your target market's specific challenges and needs. Sales Activities and Milestones: Define the key activities that will drive your sales forward. This includes prospecting methods, networking strategies, and follow-up processes. Equally important is setting realistic milestones to track progress and maintain momentum. To round things out, focusing on what matters most is about creating a strategic sales plan and maintaining discipline in your approach. This principle lays the groundwork for a successful career in sales. From outlining this plan, you’ll have a clear understanding of who your TAM will be, which leads into principle number two of the Rainmaker Sales plan – know who to call on.

# article_335_the-6-things-you-need-to-know-when-starting-an-inv

{'title': 'The 6 Things You Need to Know When Starting An Investment Sales Career', 'introduction': "As individuals, we’ve been taught to react at face value and assume someone else has thought of all the implications. This is not true for the workplace, there’s a whole new set of expectations - to think. In the work industry, there’s a set of unspoken rules no one tells you about. These rules are things managers expect but don’t tell you, or things that top performers do without realizing. Gorick Ng, Harvard career advisor, states that what separates high performers from mediocre performers is up to you to figure out on your own. He calls this trial by fire. In this article we’re breaking down six things Gorick has discovered in his time that you should put into your own practice when starting your career. After concluding this read, you’ll have a clear understanding of how to implement these objectives into your everyday agenda to stand out from peers. 1. Go the extra mile One of the unspoken rules is if you’re meeting expectations, you’re falling below expectations. The expectation is that you’re going to go above and beyond. However, the struggle lies with people not telling you what going above and beyond looks like. It’s transitioning from simply keeping up to stepping up. This starts with asking yourself why you are hired in the first place; to help your company achieve its goals. Once you identify what those goals are, you can work backwards and find a way to make yourself useful. Gorick gave a personal example from when he was given one of his first assignments to create a meeting agenda for his manager. He approached the situation as he would with a previous 6th grade teacher; they provide you with the expectations and if you meet them you get an A. He later realized approaching the situation with this mindset without being told the expectations were different. In turn, his manager was not pleased with his work. By following instructions too closely, you're not putting yourself in the best position to succeed. It’s important to anticipate what people want, what could work well, and what won’t work well so you can come to the table with all grounds covered. This leads to the next thing you should know when starting your career - having an ownership mindset. 2. Obtain an ownership mindset An ownership mindset is putting yourself in the driver’s seat rather than in the passenger seat in everything you do. If we continue with the previous example above in regard to the meeting agenda Gorick’s manager told him, “The first time I’m thinking about this is when I start this meeting with you. The last time I’m thinking about this presentation is when this meeting ends because when this meeting ends, I’m off fighting another fire. I’m counting on you to manage this whole process end to end. I want you to come to me and say, ‘Actually, I don’t think we should be doing this at all. I think we should be doing this instead.’” In all that you do, you want to polish your work like a diamond and make it as good as you possibly can. Take the ownership and make your work something you're proud of. 3. Become someone who matters In Gorick's words, the CEO notices people who matter. By implementing these principles, they end up rising to positions that may not have existed before. He gave a story of an individual who joined a marketing firm. He took a number of steps while with this firm: he built his human capital, built his social capital, and built his reputational capital. You can develop your human capital through inviting yourself to meetings, taking notes, coming up with a point of view, and going to your team with new ways of doing things. Over time you’ll develop subject matter expertise in your role. The individual grew his understanding of the subjects at hand. By inviting himself to so many meetings, he ended up knowing everyone well in the organization thus growing his social reputation. In doing his job well, he built his reputational capital and became someone who mattered and could be trusted. CEO's notice these types of people, and they become the go to people of the firm. 4. Ask why The ability to ask why you’re doing certain things in business is one of the greatest skills. The answer tends to be, “Oh, we’ve just always done it this way”, and leaves no room for growth or improvements. At Dakota, we recently made an adjustment with our Dakota Live! Calls. After simply asking why, we have now improved the experience for our members and any prospects that listen in to our call. The ability to ask questions and think about a problem drives everything in interpersonal relationships at a company. If your organization is in a growth mindset, asking why is so crucial. From this simple question you come up with great points and reasoning for what you do. If you can’t come up with any true reason other than, “We’ve always done it this way”, maybe it’s time to rethink and come up with a better option. It forces collaboration and communication with your team. 5. Switch from task orientation to goal orientation Another unspoken rule Gorick highlights is to switch from thinking about the task to thinking about the broader goal. These are the people who end up outperforming in the industry. Gorick said this was something he wishes someone had told him earlier; no one gets hired to create more paperwork, send emails, and pick up the phone. These are all just means to an end, and the end is accomplishing some broader purpose. When assigned a task, Gorick provides four questions you should ask yourself, or if you’re unsure ask the person you’re working with, “Why? What? How? By when?”. Asking these questions can provide clarity on the task at hand. Being task oriented is what school teaches you to do. If the professor says hand in assignment by 2:00 PM, you hand in your assignment at 2:00 PM. As an employee with goal orientation, you’ll be able to produce more work that matters and work that will get used. It leads to more productive teams because it’s not just about work, it’s about work for a broader purpose. 6. Understand the hidden objectives In the end, meetings always have a hidden objective: to make a decision, share information, or get alignment. From a task oriented perspective, analysts will create hundreds of slides that probably won’t get looked at in a meeting. From a goal oriented perspective analysts will understand the goal of the meeting, to make a decision to advise a client. If you’re the analyst in the meeting presenting 50 slides, you still can. However, it’s important to give the translation of what’s important. Say, “Look, I know you can see the information, but I’m going to do you the favor and tell you exactly why you should care about this.” Telling them why this matters to them. Understanding the hidden objectives will save you time, save you stress, and provide better alignment between you, your clients, and your team. Putting it all together There are plenty of things that might sound like common sense, but if you're entering your first job out of college, or you're starting somewhere new in a new field, the tips above can help you stand out from the crowd and set you off on the right path. Start by tackling one at a time, and set goals to challenge yourself to incorporate more over time. By keeping these six things in mind, you'll be on the right track to success.

{'title': 'March 2025 RIA & M&A Activity', 'introduction': "March saw a welcome bounce-back in deal volume and AUM changing hands after a down February, though one blockbuster deal may have papered over the cracks a bit. Dakota tracked 28 RIA M&A-related deal announcements during the month, well up from 16 the prior month, with at least $302.1B in AUM moving in those deals versus just $32.6B in February. However, LPL 's blockbuster acquisition of $285B Commonwealth Financial Network for $2.7B in cash made up the bulk of the month's AUM tally. Also worth noting, none of these numbers include the $7B in AUM LPL acquired from Bedminster, NJ-based The Investment Center , which closed in March but was announced back in September 2024. In fact, the next largest deal announcement in the month was Wealth Enhancement 's purchase of $3B, Cleveland-based RIA Marcum Wealth . So while March did represent something of a recovery from a down February, it still ultimately paled in comparison to the 43 deal announcements representing approximately $340B in AUM in January, which itself followed a record-setting fourth quarter. On the RIA investment side, March was even quieter than February, with Dakota tracking just four confirmed growth investments, compared to five in the month prior. A brief winter of RIA deal discontent could come up flowers in the end though, with some big M&A deals potentially in the offing -- perhaps most notably more rumblings around $10B Los Angeles RIA Churchill Management , with Focus Financial rumored to be among the possible buyers -- and Blackstone reportedly considering getting into the RIA investing via its Tactical Opportunities strategy, which is also rumored to be gearing up for a $10B Fund V fundraise.

# article_063_why-your-salespeople-are-ignoring-your-crm-and-wha

{'title': 'Why Your Salespeople Are Ignoring Your CRM (And What You Can Do About It)', 'introduction': 'Many companies invest thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of dollars into CRM systems like Salesforce. It’s a logical move: CRMs promise to streamline processes, provide actionable insights, and ultimately increase sales efficiency. But here’s the harsh reality: after all that money is spent, many companies face a serious problem - their sales teams simply don’t use it. Why does this happen? It comes down to two core problems we’ve seen time and again: improper configuration and stale, unreliable data. Both of these issues can cripple even the best CRM, turning what should be a valuable tool into an expensive headache. In this article, we’re going to address the two reasons why your CRM isn’t getting used by your sales people. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding as well as how to fix the issue at hand. So how do you save your company money as well as get a good ROI? Your answer is simple: the Marketplace for Salesforce App v.3.0. The Two Reasons Why Your Sales Teams Fail to Adopt Salesforce A CRM, no matter how advanced, is only as powerful as the people using it. If your sales team isn’t fully embracing Salesforce, it’s likely not their fault. In most cases, the problem lies in how the system has been set up. 1. It’s Not Configured for Your Team’s Needs Many companies start with a basic Salesforce setup, hoping the out-of-the-box features will be enough to get their team on board. But without customization, the CRM quickly becomes overwhelming. Too many fields, confusing data layouts, and irrelevant reports can make the system feel like more of a burden than a help. To address this, some companies hire third-party Salesforce Administrators, spending thousands more in the process. These administrators may be able to configure workflows and reports, but they don’t always understand the specific needs of your salespeople. As a result, the CRM ends up functional, but not actually useful for the people who rely on it most. When that happens, salespeople turn back to spreadsheets, emails, or even sticky notes, and your CRM starts to gather dust. 2. Data Gets Stale- and Fast One of the biggest issues with CRM systems is stale data. When your sales team doesn’t consistently use the CRM, the data quickly becomes outdated, leading to old leads, inaccurate contact information, and reports that don’t reflect the real pipeline. As data quality declines, leadership loses trust in the system, creating a vicious cycle - stale data leads to low usage, and low usage causes even more stale data. For investment sales professionals, this means missed opportunities and wasted time on non-sales activities. Instead of focusing on selling, your team spends hours manually updating records and chasing down information. And let’s be honest, when salespeople aren’t selling, your business isn’t growing. Meanwhile, Salesforce Administrators face the challenge of keeping up with a system that’s cluttered with irrelevant data, making it harder to maintain a clean, user-friendly CRM that meets the team’s evolving needs. Your Solution: The Marketplace for Salesforce App v.3.0 Enter Dakota Marketplace for Salesforce App 3.0, the solution designed to bridge the gap between underutilized CRMs and the evolving needs of modern sales teams.

As institutional investors continue to diversify their portfolios, private market allocations, especially in private credit, are set for significant expansion, underscoring the evolving landscape of global asset management. Strategically, these institutional investors have placed billions into private equity, credit, real estate, and private infrastructure driving the growth of alternative investments.

# article_344_the-3-types-of-metrics-that-will-drive-crm-adoptio

{'title': 'The 3 Types of Metrics That Will Drive CRM Adoption Across Your Investment Sales Team', 'introduction': 'Picture this: it’s Monday morning and your boss is asking to review your activity reports for the last few weeks. You know you’ve made calls and held meetings — some of them have gone really well. But you have little to show for your success because you haven’t been tracking these things in your CRM, your firm’s single source of truth. From the sounds of it, your teammates have also fallen behind. If this sounds like a familiar occurrence at your own firm, you’re not alone. We know first hand how difficult it can be to get your sales team to not just adopt a CRM, but really embrace it to help meet sales goals. Stale data, a CRM that isn’t integrated with the rest of your tech stack, and busy salespeople are all factors that can lead to a sales team’s failure to adopt a CRM. But it doesn’t have to be so hard. In fact, at Dakota, we’ve been fundraising since 2006, and with the help of our own CRM, have raised over $40 billion in that time. But how do you overcome the hurdles and ensure that your team is adopting a CRM? There are a few metrics you can measure. This is such a common question, in fact, that Salesforce released its own list of metrics you can track to drive CRM adoption across your firm. In this article, we’ll dive into what those metrics are and how you can measure them to continue to drive CRM adoption across your sales team. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear understanding of three types of metrics and how to use them to encourage widespread CRM adoption across your firm. First, let’s define what it means to “adopt” a CRM. What is CRM adoption and how do you know if it’s happening? “Adoption” is commonly used when it comes to implementing a CRM, but do you know what it means? Full “adoption” means more than just users logging into the system, and can run the gamut from a handful of users logging in to your team referring to the CRM as its single source of truth. The truth is, adoption is often somewhere in the middle. If your team has started using the system, if they’re running reports and executing against sales goals and tracking it in the CRM, chances are you’re off to a good start. What does a successful CRM adoption look like? This depends on the needs of your firm. We recommend setting clear goals and expectations for your sales team, things that are specific, measurable, and timely. You can measure these goals as a team week over week, and determine where changes need to be made and where things are really starting to come together. This is where we get into metrics. Salesforce outlines three types of metrics that you can measure to ensure your CRM is getting adopted properly. These metrics include usage, data quality, and business performance, all of which can be tracked over weeks and months to give you a clear picture of what is working. Next, we’ll dive into the metrics and what you can learn from each category. Usage metrics Usage metrics are the easiest way to see at a glance who among your team is using the platform and who isn’t. These metrics include: Users logged in - last 7 days Users not logged in - last 7 days Users never logged in Accounts created by role owner - last 120 days Opportunities created by role owner - last 60 days Contacts created by role owner - last 120 days Activities completed - last 60 days Accounts last modified by owner - last 120 days Neglected opportunities by role - last 60 days Data quality metrics Data quality metrics are key to knowing the understanding the quality of the data your team is putting into your CRM. If the data within the CRM is bad, your sales team is not just less likely to use it, but less likely to fix it. These metrics include: Opportunities with a close date - last 60 days Stage in which opportunities are entered Prospect accounts with missing information - last 60 days Lead rating on converted leads Accounts with all key fields populated Accounts missing rating field Key, non-required fields filled out Business performance metrics The goal of a CRM is to make your firm, and especially your sales and marketing teams, more efficient. Check in on the metrics below to see if it’s working to do just that: Pipeline by owner or owner role Monthly sales trends Activity type by assigned towner Win ratio for current and prior year Open leads by owner role - open not contacted Deal type by owners winning Deal type by owners losing How to use Salesforce to measure internal KPIs In sales, we all know how critical it is to hit your goals — you don’t have time to waste. At Dakota, we’ve made using our CRM part of our sales DNA. How? By tracking our own goals and progress using Salesforce, as well as using it to create a killer follow-up system for the team. At the beginning of every week, we review activity and opportunity reports as a team. This allows everyone to have insight into progress, and ensures that the data within the CRM stays fresh. If you go to review your own KPIs and find things missing or incomplete, you will know that there is an adoption problem on your team. How to start encouraging CRM adoption at your firm While this looks different for everyone, there are some steps you can take early on to encourage your sales team to make using a CRM part of their day to day activities. At Dakota, we’ve found three things to be incredibly helpful: Set daily or weekly sales meetings to review activity reports. This is a surefire way to know who is adopting your CRM and who isn’t. Use your CRM as a way of tracking activity and meetings. This will help trigger follow-up actions, and ensure that the sales team is consistently using the system. Make using the CRM part of your company training. This way, as new team members join the team, they have the expectation from day one that they’ll be using and updating their CRM. And finally, set measurable, timely goals that you can measure within the system!', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'The 3 Types of Metrics That Will Drive CRM Adoption Across Your Investment Sales Team', 'content': 'Picture this: it’s Monday morning and your boss is asking to review your activity reports for the last few weeks.

# article_117_the-true-cost-of-clean-investment-sales-data-a-bre

{'title': 'The True Cost of Clean Investment Sales Data: A Breakdown', 'introduction': 'As a salesperson or a sales leader, you have one enemy greater than all the others. Sure, rejections are part of the job, but this is worse than a simple rejection. It’s something that stops you from doing your job well, or, sometimes, doing your job at all. What is it? You probably already know: stale, outdated data. Stale data causes you to waste valuable time chasing down contact information and finding the right people to call on. Instead of having a full database of leads you can take action against, you have to hunt down emails and job titles on LinkedIn, firm websites, wherever you can. Clean data also comes at a cost. Which is why we’re breaking down what it would cost for a firm to hire a full-time data research analyst to keep your data as clean and up-to-date as possible. Of course, a full-time role is not the only option here. You can also choose to invest in a database that updates itself on a daily, consistent basis. But which is worth your investment? In this article we’re going to give you a cost breakdown of hiring a full-time data research team in order to compare purchasing an institutional investor database. By the end of the article, you’ll have a better understanding of the two costs, as well as an understanding which is worth your investment. To start, we’ll break down the three defined areas of cost when it comes to hiring a data research analyst for your firm. The three defined areas of costs 1. Personnel to maintain existing data. This includes anything and everything from updating emails, phone numbers, job changes, new hires and exits to prospect and customer firms; maintaining the key information on each account: what they buy/don’t buy, and staying updated on recent updates and news on each account, just to name a few. 2. Personnel to add new data. The lifeblood of any sales organization is the “new.” Finding the “new” means locating new prospects to sell your products or services to. To do this effectively, dedicated team members are needed to continually find new accounts and contacts for your sales team to call on and build relationships with. 3. Various software and tools. Even with an in-house staff, you’ll need to equip them with the software and tools they need to ensure that all the data is clean. For example, these tools can include platforms like: Seamless, Neverbounce, Emailable, Rocketreach, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, among others. All of these tools come at a cost and should be calculated into your overall spending for data maintenance. How much does it cost to add personnel to maintain existing data? This cost will vary based on the size of your database and how much data is within it. Once you know that number, you can estimate that one Data Research Analyst is needed per every 15-20K contacts in your database. The estimated cost for a new data team member (all-in with benefits and associated employment costs) is approximately $100,000. small free trial banner How much does it cost to add personnel to find new opportunity data? At least one data team member should be dedicated to “finding the new” at any organization. If your firm is attempting to access new channels, new geographies, etc., more new data team members could be needed depending on the scope and goals of the sales team. As stated above, the estimated cost for a new data team member (all-in with benefits and associated employment costs) is approximately $100,000. How much do you need to budget for data cleansing software tools? Additional software tools and licenses can cost anywhere from $25-30K per year or more depending on the size of your team. Additionally, it should be noted that in addition to software, other costs may arise as well, such as: CRM licenses for each data team member Professional LinkedIn tools to help track employment changes (new hires, terminations, role changes) at your prospects and customers One or more email tools to test existing emails addresses to identify bounced emails and to identify new email addresses where needed Website change detection software to identify when prospects or customers or other necessary information on variety of websites has changed Next, we’ll run through some examples based on database size, and help outline the estimated cost for each. How many data team members do you need, and what will it cost? In this section, we’ll break down how many employees you’ll need depending on the size of your dataset, and add in additional costs such as software and other tools. These costs are estimates based on Dakota’s on research, internal team, and can of course vary by firm and needs. Example database: 35K contacts, normal effort to identify new prospects, and software tools: 2 professionals for existing data: $200K 1 professional for new data:$100K Software tools: $30K Total estimated annual cost $330K Example database: 50K contacts, effort to enter new channels with existing products: 3 professionals for existing data: $300K 2 professionals for new data: $200K Software tools: $30K Total estimated annual cost- $530K These costs, which can be anything from $330,000 to $530,000 per year, show that maintaining clean and accurate data is a critical investment, but it is a big investment. Is there any other way to keep your data updated? The numbers above can seem overwhelming and huge, we know. But, all is not lost. While it’s imperative that your data stays fresh and accurate, you don’t necessarily need to employ an entire data team yourself. In fact, many firms don’t have the resources or the budget to do this, and have turned to outside institutional investor databases to provide that clean and accurate data for them. While a database can come at a cost as well, it’s a fraction of what it would take to hire and retain an in-house data team. An institutional investor database can cost anywhere from $5,000 to over $30,000 per year, depending on the needs of your firm. There are plenty of considerations and questions you should ask before you invest in a platform, including the number of new leads you’re looking for, the budget allotted, channel focus, and more. small free trial banner Is an institutional investor database right for your firm? Again, this all depends on your individual needs, and factors such as outcomes, budgets, and the size of the dataset all come into play here. There are dozens of institutional investor databases on the market, including Money Market Directory, Nasdaq eVestment, PitchBook and more which we’ve outlined in this article. Of course, we’d be doing ourselves a disservice if we did not mention our own database, Dakota Marketplace. We’ll jump into that next. What is Dakota Marketplace? Dakota Marketplace is our own institutional investor database and an all-in-one solution that provides investment sales teams with complete and accurate data to help accelerate their fundraising efforts. The platform is the database of our own Investment Sales team, who have been fundraising since 2006.

You’ll be able to: Create targeted lists: Create custom views and reports on exactly the allocators, asset classes, and people you most want to target. Track industry turnover: The investment industry moves fast. Make sure you’re always calling on the right person, in the right role, at the right place, without wasting any time on bad emails and contact information. Maximize your travel: Make the most of your travel time with the Map It feature.

Access industry insights: Access weekly insights from our Dakota Live! Calls and monthly Emerging Manager Growth Shows and Rainmaker Live! Sales Training sessions all in one place. A subscription to Dakota Marketplace is $15,500 per year, and $1,000 for each additional user license. What if I don’t want to purchase a full database? Purchasing a whole new database of accounts and contacts can seem overwhelming upon the initial thought. If you’re used to working from your CRM, spreadsheets, and papers – it can be a lot to “start over.” This transition often involves significant changes in workflows, data migration challenges, and the learning curve associated with a new system. The familiarity and comfort with existing tools and processes can make the idea of switching to a new database daunting. Additionally, if you and your team are working on a smaller scale, a larger database full of information may not be 100% applicable to you. Smaller teams may not need the extensive range of data that a comprehensive database offers. Instead, they might require more targeted, specific information that aligns closely with their niche markets or specific fundraising goals. The excess data in a large database can be unnecessary and overwhelming, leading to inefficiencies rather than productivity gains. Smaller platforms tend to be more affordable than an all-encompassing database since you are purchasing a limited amount of data. This affordability can be particularly attractive for smaller firms or startups with tighter budgets. By opting for a smaller platform, you can ensure that you are only paying for the data you need and can manage, avoiding the higher costs associated with larger databases that come with extensive, and sometimes superfluous, data sets. If you’re not looking to start fresh with a new database, considering a smaller platform is an alternative.

Now that you know the approximate costs associated with hiring a data team and buying an institutional investor database, it’s time to make some decisions. Either way, it’s a huge investment. While we think clean data is an absolutely critical component of building a strong sales team, we also know it comes at a high cost. Hiring a Data Team: If you have a small team and a small dataset, are growing rapidly, are expanding your team, or want to see exactly what goes into your database every day, an in-house data management team might be the best fit for your firm. This option provides complete control over your data processes and ensures that your team can tailor data collection and maintenance to meet specific needs and goals. Purchasing an Institutional Investor Database: If you want to focus on selling rather than data maintenance, are just starting out, or want the certainty that all of your contact data will be reviewed on a daily basis, then an institutional investor database is the best fit for your firm. This option offers a cost-effective and efficient solution with regularly updated and accurate data, allowing your team to concentrate on core sales activities without the burden of data management. Purchasing a Smaller Platform: If you’re not looking to start fresh with a new database, considering a smaller platform is an alternative. For firms working on a smaller scale, a smaller platform like DealSignal can provide targeted, high-quality data that is more affordable and manageable, offering an effective solution without the overwhelming scope and cost of a full-scale database.

Sure, rejections are part of the job, but this is worse than a simple rejection. It’s something that stops you from doing your job well, or, sometimes, doing your job at all. What is it? You probably already know: stale, outdated data. Stale data causes you to waste valuable time chasing down contact information and finding the right people to call on. Instead of having a full database of leads you can take action against, you have to hunt down emails and job titles on LinkedIn, firm websites, wherever you can. Clean data also comes at a cost. Which is why we’re breaking down what it would cost for a firm to hire a full-time data research analyst to keep your data as clean and up-to-date as possible. Of course, a full-time role is not the only option here. You can also choose to invest in a database that updates itself on a daily, consistent basis. But which is worth your investment? In this article we’re going to give you a cost breakdown of hiring a full-time data research team in order to compare purchasing an institutional investor database. By the end of the article, you’ll have a better understanding of the two costs, as well as an understanding which is worth your investment. To start, we’ll break down the three defined areas of cost when it comes to hiring a data research analyst for your firm. The three defined areas of costs 1. Personnel to maintain existing data. This includes anything and everything from updating emails, phone numbers, job changes, new hires and exits to prospect and customer firms; maintaining the key information on each account: what they buy/don’t buy, and staying updated on recent updates and news on each account, just to name a few. 2. Personnel to add new data. The lifeblood of any sales organization is the “new.” Finding the “new” means locating new prospects to sell your products or services to. To do this effectively, dedicated team members are needed to continually find new accounts and contacts for your sales team to call on and build relationships with. 3. Various software and tools. Even with an in-house staff, you’ll need to equip them with the software and tools they need to ensure that all the data is clean. For example, these tools can include platforms like: Seamless, Neverbounce, Emailable, Rocketreach, LinkedIn Sales Navigator, among others. All of these tools come at a cost and should be calculated into your overall spending for data maintenance. How much does it cost to add personnel to maintain existing data? This cost will vary based on the size of your database and how much data is within it. Once you know that number, you can estimate that one Data Research Analyst is needed per every 15-20K contacts in your database. The estimated cost for a new data team member (all-in with benefits and associated employment costs) is approximately $100,000. small free trial banner How much does it cost to add personnel to find new opportunity data? At least one data team member should be dedicated to “finding the new” at any organization. If your firm is attempting to access new channels, new geographies, etc., more new data team members could be needed depending on the scope and goals of the sales team. As stated above, the estimated cost for a new data team member (all-in with benefits and associated employment costs) is approximately $100,000. How much do you need to budget for data cleansing software tools? Additional software tools and licenses can cost anywhere from $25-30K per year or more depending on the size of your team. Additionally, it should be noted that in addition to software, other costs may arise as well, such as: CRM licenses for each data team member Professional LinkedIn tools to help track employment changes (new hires, terminations, role changes) at your prospects and customers One or more email tools to test existing emails addresses to identify bounced emails and to identify new email addresses where needed Website change detection software to identify when prospects or customers or other necessary information on variety of websites has changed Next, we’ll run through some examples based on database size, and help outline the estimated cost for each. How many data team members do you need, and what will it cost? In this section, we’ll break down how many employees you’ll need depending on the size of your dataset, and add in additional costs such as software and other tools. These costs are estimates based on Dakota’s on research, internal team, and can of course vary by firm and needs. Example database: 35K contacts, normal effort to identify new prospects, and software tools: 2 professionals for existing data: $200K 1 professional for new data:$100K Software tools: $30K Total estimated annual cost $330K Example database: 50K contacts, effort to enter new channels with existing products: 3 professionals for existing data: $300K 2 professionals for new data: $200K Software tools: $30K Total estimated annual cost- $530K These costs, which can be anything from $330,000 to $530,000 per year, show that maintaining clean and accurate data is a critical investment, but it is a big investment. Is there any other way to keep your data updated? The numbers above can seem overwhelming and huge, we know. But, all is not lost. While it’s imperative that your data stays fresh and accurate, you don’t necessarily need to employ an entire data team yourself. In fact, many firms don’t have the resources or the budget to do this, and have turned to outside institutional investor databases to provide that clean and accurate data for them. While a database can come at a cost as well, it’s a fraction of what it would take to hire and retain an in-house data team. An institutional investor database can cost anywhere from $5,000 to over $30,000 per year, depending on the needs of your firm. There are plenty of considerations and questions you should ask before you invest in a platform, including the number of new leads you’re looking for, the budget allotted, channel focus, and more. small free trial banner Is an institutional investor database right for your firm? Again, this all depends on your individual needs, and factors such as outcomes, budgets, and the size of the dataset all come into play here. There are dozens of institutional investor databases on the market, including Money Market Directory, Nasdaq eVestment, PitchBook and more which we’ve outlined in this article. Of course, we’d be doing ourselves a disservice if we did not mention our own database, Dakota Marketplace. We’ll jump into that next. What is Dakota Marketplace? Dakota Marketplace is our own institutional investor database and an all-in-one solution that provides investment sales teams with complete and accurate data to help accelerate their fundraising efforts. The platform is the database of our own Investment Sales team, who have been fundraising since 2006.

Track industry turnover: The investment industry moves fast.

Access industry insights: Access weekly insights from our Dakota Live! Calls and monthly Emerging Manager Growth Shows and Rainmaker Live! Sales Training sessions all in one place. A subscription to Dakota Marketplace is $15,500 per year, and $1,000 for each additional user license. What if I don’t want to purchase a full database? Purchasing a whole new database of accounts and contacts can seem overwhelming upon the initial thought. If you’re used to working from your CRM, spreadsheets, and papers – it can be a lot to “start over.” This transition often involves significant changes in workflows, data migration challenges, and the learning curve associated with a new system. The familiarity and comfort with existing tools and processes can make the idea of switching to a new database daunting. Additionally, if you and your team are working on a smaller scale, a larger database full of information may not be 100% applicable to you. Smaller teams may not need the extensive range of data that a comprehensive database offers. Instead, they might require more targeted, specific information that aligns closely with their niche markets or specific fundraising goals. The excess data in a large database can be unnecessary and overwhelming, leading to inefficiencies rather than productivity gains. Smaller platforms tend to be more affordable than an all-encompassing database since you are purchasing a limited amount of data. This affordability can be particularly attractive for smaller firms or startups with tighter budgets. By opting for a smaller platform, you can ensure that you are only paying for the data you need and can manage, avoiding the higher costs associated with larger databases that come with extensive, and sometimes superfluous, data sets. If you’re not looking to start fresh with a new database, considering a smaller platform is an alternative. A smaller, more focused data platform can provide the essential data needed for your fundraising efforts without the overwhelming scope and cost of a large-scale database. Which is where we’ll talk about DealSignal. DealSignal DealSignal is a B2B data platform full of comprehensive, fresh, and accurate data to power your sales and marketing performance.

# article_259_public-plan-commitments-summary-for-january-2023

{'title': 'Public Plan Commitments Summary For January 2023', 'introduction': 'January public pension plan commitment summary points: The first month of 2023 has treated public equity markets with much less volatility VS how 2022 began and has been a welcome change for both allocators and managers. The same is true with the bulk of the fixed income markets reflected via less spread movement across most fixed income sub-sectors as allocators have more information on the Fed’s intentions today, VS a year ago. With 2022 now closed, the Public Pension funded ratio closed out the year at 8% VS 74.7% in 2021. Heavy concentration among public pensions in real estate and private equity were major factors, in addition to higher employer contributions. These all contributed to public pensions ending 2022 in a stronger position than 2021. In January we saw 103 individual commitments totaling $8.56 B allocated among 73 individual managers. This compares to 158 commitments made last month but is typical for the new year to start slow due to less committee meetings taking place. 44 individual pension funds made commitments in January. The top allocator moves during the month were: NY State Common shifting $1.63 billion. Washington State Investment Board allocating $1.025 billion. Texas Teachers allocating $925 million. Asset Classes- Private Equity had been allocated the most via asset class at 43% of commitments which is the largest percentage we have seen since covering public commitments, with Real Assets receiving 19% and the highest for Real Assets in over a year, and Private Credit with 16% of commitments. Sub Asset Classes- Private Equity Middle Market Buyout was the largest sub-asset allocation taking in 18% of commitments, in second and as we had noted last year Infrastructure allocations have been consistent and this month took in 16%. Many of the committee notes we reviewed stated these allocations are in response to “carbon/greening” investment opportunities in addition to consistent global need for private funding of infrastructure projects. Private Equity Large Buyout took in 10% of allocations. The biggest shift in allocations was the drop in real estate allocations in general but given the amount of capital allocated here since 2021 looks to be mean reverting. Looking at the top shifts made this month: NY Common had terminated $483 million out of Rockefeller Asset Management’s Global Equities fund, this caught our attention as this was one of the larger equity shifts we have seen from them over the last year. They have yet to replace this mandate. $350 million into Apollo’s Large Buyout Fund X and $300 million into another large buyout fund, Hellman & Friedman Capital Partners XI. Washington State allocated $500 million to the Stonepeak Infrastructure Core Fund, another $300 million to Global Infrastructure Partners V, and a VC allocation of $225 million to Menlo ventures. This is largest allocation WA State has made to infrastructure in a number of years as the majority of dollars had gone to Private Equity. It is worth highlighting that San Diego CERS allocated $400 million across four fixed income mandates focused on total return and global total return run by Wellington, PIMCO, Apollo and Guggenheim. Additionally, New Hampshire Retirement allocated $160 million to core/total return mandates. This is the largest single month allocation we have seen to “traditional fixed income” in over 14 months and could signal an allocation shift back into core bond mandates by committees.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'Public Plan Commitments Summary For January 2023', 'content': 'January public pension plan commitment summary points: The first month of 2023 has treated public equity markets with much less volatility VS how 2022 began and has been a welcome change for both allocators and managers.

{'title': 'The Top 10 RIAs in London', 'introduction': "If you're in investment sales, you likely already know that one of the biggest problems of selling to the RIA  channel is the sheer size of it.

{'title': 'Why City Scheduling Works: The Smartest Strategy for Investment Sales Teams', 'introduction': 'Time and focus are your most valuable assets in sales, and both are wasted the moment your effort is misdirected. City Scheduling isn’t just a tactic; it’s a system designed to ensure every minute of your day drives results. Sales is a game of precision, not persuasion. Too many salespeople waste time trying to persuade the wrong people instead of targeting the right ones. When you “ Know Who to Call On ” and pair it with City Scheduling, you flip that dynamic. It’s far more efficient, and profitable, to find someone who already buys apples than to convince an orange buyer to like apples. This principle saves time, reduces friction, and boosts conversion rates because your effort is aligned with fit. In this article, we’ll be discussing why City Scheduling works. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of how to bring structure to your day. Reduces Cognitive Overload and Inaction An unstructured list of thousands of potential accounts is overwhelming, that mental clutter leads to procrastination, inconsistent outreach, or outright inaction. Humans are wired to avoid complexity. Without a clear system, the work feels too big to tackle. City Scheduling solves this by breaking the work down into manageable, focused chunks: one city, one day, five meetings. It’s the antidote to paralysis by analysis. Brings Discipline to the Sales Process Sales success comes from consistency, not bursts of motivation. Without a framework like City Scheduling, it’s easy to get pulled into reactive work like tweaking the pitch deck, refreshing the website, or just “checking in” on emails. High performers don’t rely on motivation. They rely on systems. City Scheduling gives you a discipline loop that keeps outreach and new relationship-building on track, regardless of distractions. Builds Market Familiarity and Momentum Even when you don’t book a meeting, repeated, focused outreach in a single city builds recognition over time. People start to remember your name and your firm. Follow-up becomes easier. Future meetings become more likely. Familiarity breeds trust, and trust increases open rates, response rates, and yes rates. City Scheduling creates a local network effect that compounds over time. Makes Leadership Measurable and Repeatable For sales leaders, this approach solves a major challenge: guiding activity without micromanaging. Most managers don’t want to babysit, they want to coach effective systems. Requiring every rep to have five cities on the calendar isn’t control; it’s an objective, scalable framework. It allows leaders to measure focus, ensure pipeline coverage, and drive accountability in a way that’s repeatable and predictable. The Bottom Line Know Who to Call On and use City Scheduling because they direct your finite time and energy toward the highest-probability outcomes. They give you structure, scale, and focus: the keys to consistent results in investment sales. This isn’t about calling on everyone. It’s about calling on the right people, in the right metro areas, in the right way, every single week. That’s how you win this game.

# article_368_how-to-bring-your-investment-firms-story-to-life

{'title': "How to Bring Your Investment Firm's Story to Life", 'introduction': 'In investment sales, there’s a huge focus on getting the meeting, often at the expense of crafting a strong pitch. That oversight represents a critical misstep. Anytime you make a pitch, there’s a lot at stake – capital for the firm and your compensation. For you, a lot is riding on your ability to tell a compelling story about your strategy. Nail it and you’re golden; fail, and, well, there’s always tomorrow. But you’re not the only one with something at stake. Every time an allocator recommends an investment strategy, they’re taking a career risk. Every time you sit down to pitch an investment strategy, you’re asking them to take a career risk. If they recommend a strategy that performs poorly, it could cost them their job. That’s why the pitch is pivotal. For the institutional investor sitting across from you, “no” is the safest answer. It’s your job to make them understand as deeply as they can what you do and how you do it. That’s an imposing task. But strong messaging and storytelling has the power to provide all the information your buyer wants in a way that will make them comfortable with your strategy and give them the confidence to potentially allocate to it. Through narrative, both written and visual, you can control the story being told about your strategy and the words used to describe it, and significantly increase the probability of getting an allocation. At Dakota, we’ve been raising money on behalf of boutique investment firms since 2006, and have raised over $35 billion in that time. We’ve turned storytelling into a major part of how we work with our partners, and have continued to find value in refining that process over the years. In this article, we’re explaining how you can become a masterful storyteller and bring your firm and your story to life. By the end of this article, you’ll know how to position and explain your firm so that you’re answering the questions due diligence analysts want answered, all while keeping them engaged from beginning to end. 1. Approach your story from the eye of the portfolio manager, not from the pitch deck Before you attempt to tell your story to someone else, you have to be sure you know it yourself. After all, every investment strategy of worth will have a story, and a story that makes sense to the listener. Your job is to pull that out. To start out, ask the Portfolio Manager a couple questions. First: What gets you excited to come to work in the morning? Once you get to the underlying passion they have for investing and investing in their underlying strategy, you’ll be able to pull from that passion and their words. After that, it’s about continuing to dig into that narrative, and keep digging and asking why. And while this type of conversation will give you a firm understanding of the passion they have, that doesn’t mean the story is being told the proper way. Our job is to figure out the best part of the story and the best way to tell it. At Dakota, we like to call this “the mom test.” If you were telling your mom the highlights of your firm, would she understand it? Tell your story by highlighting where your unique capabilities lie, and be able to execute on it, keeping it thoughtful and simple. If you know the story by heart, and weave in the passion of real people, the story will be truly yours, and not something you simply read off of a slide. 2. Be a master messenger What does it mean to be a master messenger? It means knowing your story and telling it eloquently in a meeting with a due diligence analyst. These meetings are where you have the chance to really bring the story to life, and give you the opportunity to have a conversation with your potential buyer. The better you make the story sound, the more excited the potential buyer will be. The goal is to create excitement. What makes you unique? How can your firm stand out in a portfolio? Before you can truly build excitement, you’ll need time to answer roughly fifteen to twenty questions about your firm. What are the table stakes questions you know your buyer is going to want answers to? These can include things like: Firm name Year founded Track record AUM Assets by product in the strategy (You can read more about which questions to ask and when in another recent article: A Guide to Video for Investment Firms, which breaks them down in even more detail.) Tell the analysts about your strategy in a very distinct way. This allows the buyer to frame where they would fit you in their existing portfolio, and allows them to ask questions about performance in specific scenarios. At the end of the day, you need the story to be easy to understand. Most analysts have many other things going on, which means you need to make it easy for them to know where you fit. Keeping it simple will help you win in the long run. 3. Know where and how to supply your story and the information within it We’ve found that 95% of the time, a firm’s story will be housed in the brains of the investment salespeople. These stories often don’t make it onto paper, the website, or into a video. It’s your job to not only find out the story, but how you can use it and when. The best firms are the ones that put all that information (how you as an investment salesperson answer key questions), and put it in various formats for people to consume them. Because RFPs are done with compliance-laden language, they cannot accurately depict how your specific firm answers questions. So that means, in order for someone to get to know your firm, you have to tell the story yourself. We know how the due diligence analysts want it written. But you can share that story in other formats like: PDF, video, on your website, and within databases where people go to get information on investment strategies. However you choose to share the story, you need to be able to email and share it, whether it’s in a podcast, written, or video format. How to get started bringing your firm’s story to life The first step to telling a compelling story is to start asking questions. Sit down for a conversation with your portfolio, and really get to the heart of why they do what they do. That passion will allow you to keep asking questions and digging deeper into what makes them tick and keeps them going. Having this kind of energy when you’re in a meeting or sharing an introductory video about your firm will set you apart from the firms relying on strictly RFPs and pitch decks to get them to the finish line. Start by finding the passion within the story, and then use that to propel you forward. Need help defining which questions to ask and when? Struggling to really bring your story to life? We’d love to schedule a 15-minute consultation with Dakota Studios, our world-class studio space that provides marketing assets to investment firms like yours. Our team will ensure that you’re answering the questions due diligence analysts want answered.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': "How to Bring Your Investment Firm's Story to Life", 'content': 'In investment sales, there’s a huge focus on getting the meeting, often at the expense of crafting a strong pitch.

These can include things like: Firm name Year founded Track record AUM Assets by product in the strategy (You can read more about which questions to ask and when in another recent article: A Guide to Video for Investment Firms, which breaks them down in even more detail.) Tell the analysts about your strategy in a very distinct way. This allows the buyer to frame where they would fit you in their existing portfolio, and allows them to ask questions about performance in specific scenarios. At the end of the day, you need the story to be easy to understand. Most analysts have many other things going on, which means you need to make it easy for them to know where you fit. Keeping it simple will help you win in the long run. 3. Know where and how to supply your story and the information within it We’ve found that 95% of the time, a firm’s story will be housed in the brains of the investment salespeople. These stories often don’t make it onto paper, the website, or into a video. It’s your job to not only find out the story, but how you can use it and when. The best firms are the ones that put all that information (how you as an investment salesperson answer key questions), and put it in various formats for people to consume them. Because RFPs are done with compliance-laden language, they cannot accurately depict how your specific firm answers questions. So that means, in order for someone to get to know your firm, you have to tell the story yourself. We know how the due diligence analysts want it written. But you can share that story in other formats like: PDF, video, on your website, and within databases where people go to get information on investment strategies. However you choose to share the story, you need to be able to email and share it, whether it’s in a podcast, written, or video format. How to get started bringing your firm’s story to life The first step to telling a compelling story is to start asking questions. Sit down for a conversation with your portfolio, and really get to the heart of why they do what they do. That passion will allow you to keep asking questions and digging deeper into what makes them tick and keeps them going. Having this kind of energy when you’re in a meeting or sharing an introductory video about your firm will set you apart from the firms relying on strictly RFPs and pitch decks to get them to the finish line. Start by finding the passion within the story, and then use that to propel you forward. Need help defining which questions to ask and when? Struggling to really bring your story to life? We’d love to schedule a 15-minute consultation with Dakota Studios, our world-class studio space that provides marketing assets to investment firms like yours. Our team will ensure that you’re answering the questions due diligence analysts want answered.', 'bullet_points': [], 'subsections': []}], 'key_takeaways': [], 'faqs': []}

# article_390_4-common-institutional-investor-database-myths

{'title': '4 Common Institutional Investor Database Myths', 'introduction': "Have you ever sat down to start your day, only to find your inbox flooded with other salespeople offering to sell you a “database” of accounts and contacts? If the answer is yes, we can guarantee you’re not alone in this. This is a common occurrence in the investment industry. So much so that “database” itself has become something of a negative. We get it. We’ve been on the receiving end of hundreds of those messages over the years, each one deleted, unopened, because we know exactly what they’re promising: a list of accounts and contacts from the sender’s former firm, available for a few hundred dollars. Which, of course, is not a database at all, but an Excel spreadsheet that will be outdated almost as soon as we open it. We’re all tired of it, but not all databases will leave a bad taste in your mouth. In fact, many of them, Preqin, Discovery Data, and RIA Database, for example, have good, well-respected reputations within the industry. And yet there are still common questions and misconceptions about what it means to subscribe to an institutional investor database. As a database company ourselves, we at Dakota have the expertise to offer insight, but we’ve received enough of those unsolicited database emails to know that simply telling you that the answer to your problems with our product is not the way to go. Instead, in this article we’ll delve into those database myths and misconceptions, breaking down which are truly myths, and which might just hold some truth. By the end of this post, you’ll be able to make a more informed decision the next time you’re considering a database subscription for your team. What is an institutional investor database? Before we dive into the myths surrounding institutional investor databases, let’s talk about what an institutional investor database actually is, since we’ve already established that it’s not a list of accounts and contacts in an Excel spreadsheet. An institutional investor database is an online database application that not only helps your team identify new prospects and opportunities for your sales team to pursue, but also helps keep you up to date on changes within firms across the country. As people move and change jobs, you’re still always calling on the right people. Additionally, an institutional investor database functions similar to, or inside of, a CRM, helping to track calls, meetings, and notes across your team, so that everyone stays connected about outreach and productivity. It helps your team stay engaged with each other as well as your prospects and partners, and helps to hold them accountable to meeting firm fundraising goals. But, at the end of the day, an institutional investor database should do one thing above all else: help your sales team call on the right people, and close more business. Common institutional investor database myths 1. Databases are static and become outdated quickly This is an idea that has been propagated largely by those sales emails we mentioned earlier, which have come to build mistrust across the investment industry. If you download a spreadsheet without knowing where the data within it came from, you also don’t know how accurate it is. It could very well be out of date by the time it reaches your inbox. This leads to databases being forgotten, money wasted, and the salesperson right back at square one: researching contacts for who to call on. It’s this trend that has made a lot of institutional investment salespeople leery of databases. Typically the information within these documents is unorganized, out of date, and limited. After all, there is only so much information that can reside within the lines of an Excel spreadsheet. However, while it’s true that Excel spreadsheets of contact information are static by nature, this isn’t true of databases that are built as online database applications that are updated on a regular or semi-regular basis by teams of professionals in the industry. Verdict: Myth. This is true for data contained within spreadsheets, but online database applications are updated on a regular or semi-regular basis. 2. They contain too much data that doesn’t pertain to my needs Institutional investor databases come in a variety of sizes depending on your needs. Some, such as Preqin and Discovery Data, come with hundreds of thousands of data points, including accounts and contacts. For some, this can be overwhelming, and even more than you need to make calls and set meetings. This amount of information is perfect if you’re just starting out or trying to get a sense of a particular market, but it can be true that there is simply too much information that becomes overwhelming to sift through. However, there are databases that are specific to certain channels. For example, RIA database is specific to the RIA channel, and Preqin focuses on alternative investment strategies only. Additionally, there are products like Dakota Marketplace, which hones in on firms that allocate to outside managers, and allows the user to filter by channel. and are more curated to fit certain needs, like RIA Database and Dakota Marketplace. Verdict: Misunderstanding. Not all databases are created equally, or serve the same purpose, so it's true that some can contain too much information that doesn’t pertain to you. 3. Institutional investor databases aren’t built for salespeople Often, databases are laid out in a way that can be difficult to navigate, especially for salespeople, who are typically pressed for time and trying to be as efficient as possible. Especially for larger databases, it can be hard to find exactly what you need when you need it, due to the sheer amount of information within it. Additionally, most databases are built for a more general audience, and therefore not organized in a way that is optimal for how sales professionals work (by channel or metro area). Because salespeople are so often on the road, they are trying to fill their trips with meetings in a certain city, or flesh out a certain channel. While some databases are not built with this in mind, there are some that are specific to a channel (RIA Database caters to specifically the RIA channel) and Dakota Marketplace (which allows users to filter by metro area). Verdict: Myth. While it’s true that some databases are more general, there are some that are designed specifically for how salespeople work. 4. Databases are an administrative nightmare There are a few instances where this can be true. First, let’s talk about those Excel spreadsheets we keep mentioning. Because they are static and often outdated, they end up creating more work for the salesperson. You might find yourself having to go in and ensure that everything is accurate, and then spend your time tracking down accounts and contact information rather than setting meetings. Additionally, if you’re subscribed to a database with hundreds of thousands of data points, the same might be true. Because there is so much data within the database, they are often updated monthly rather than daily or weekly, and it’s possible a salesperson will have to go in and update or validate information themselves. However, if the database you’re subscribed to is on the smaller side, it is likely updated daily or weekly which eliminates the administrative component that tends to frustrate sales teams. Verdict: Misunderstanding. Because databases vary in size and scope, this can be true for some but not others. So, do institutional investor databases deserve their bad reputation? For the most part, the answer to this is no. While there are a lot of misunderstandings surrounding institutional investor databases, a lot of the assumptions made about them tend to be just that: assumptions and myths. Rogue, one-off operators offering Excel spreadsheets give databases as a whole a bad name, and what gives the bigger firms like Preqin and RIA Database, etc. a bad name is that in general, the key information can be overwhelming or inaccurate. However, if you find the database that fits your firm’s needs and size, the benefits will far outweigh the drawbacks. Is an institutional investor database right for you? It’s probably no secret that we think the answer is yes, a well-curated, updated database can only benefit an investment sales team. Now that we’ve walked through the common database myths and misunderstandings, it’s time to prove to your team that an institutional investor database can add true value and ROI to your business. This article outlines the three major benefits that an institutional investor database can provide, and will help your team move forward in the decision making process. If you’re ready to find out how Dakota Marketplace, a curated institutional investor database created by a team of current investment salespeople can transform your team, we’d love to schedule a call or a demo.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': '4 Common Institutional Investor Database Myths', 'content': "Have you ever sat down to start your day, only to find your inbox flooded with other salespeople offering to sell you a “database” of accounts and contacts?

# article_347_the-8-best-crms-for-private-equity-firms

{'title': 'The 8 Best CRMs for Private Equity Firms', 'introduction': "Have you ever found yourself scrambling, trying to remember who you met with last week, two weeks ago, even a month ago? You know you have to follow up, but you’re just not sure with whom. It’s a terrible feeling, and one we’ve all felt before, especially in the investment sales business. However, as we’ve said time and again, following up after a meeting is critical. It can mean the difference between building a relationship and getting an allocation and being forgotten, and we all know which outcome we want. After all, you’re not putting in all that work to set the meeting in the first place for nothing, right? Right. That means, you need to be diligent about following up, and we whole-heartedly believe that you can’t do that without a CRM. At Dakota, we eat, sleep, and breathe our CRM, using it for everything from following up after a meeting to reporting and keeping up to date on meeting notes. For this, we use Salesforce, but we know not everyone’s budgets or needs are the same. Which is why, in this article, we’re going to highlight eight of the best CRM platforms specifically for private equity firms. 1. Salesforce With over 150,000 customers around the world and originally built for the investment management industry, Salesforce is one of the most widely-recognized CRM options available. There are countless use cases, customizations, and possibilities for you within their systems, and can accommodate every team in your organization, from sales and marketing to IT and customer service. This makes it a scalable solution, though with that flexibility also comes an impressive price tag, with user licenses ranging anywhere from $75 to hundreds of dollars per month, per user. Depending on your budget and needs, there are more affordable solutions available. 2. Hubspot With over 86,000 customers, Hubspot is a well-recognized CRM and inbound marketing solution. Hubspot offers a free option, which allows companies to get a sense of the product and what it can do, as well as more advanced, paid solutions.

{'title': 'October 2024 Financial Advisor Moves and RIA Acquisitions', 'introduction': "The M&A floodgates opened in October, with Dakota tracking 37 outright acquisitions – by all accounts a record monthly haul – involving over $255B in client assets, along with a handful of minority-stake transactions by strategic investors.

Movement by independent advisors also remained strong in the month, led by LPL Financial with eight additions representing $4.9B in total incorporated assets, followed by seven recruitments by Raymond James representing $4.6B in assets. Finally, other noteworthy developments in the month included Hightower Advisors taking a controlling stake in investment consultant and OCIO solutions provider NEPC and alternative investments technology platform CAIS forming an RIA unit to assist financial advisors in alternatives portfolio construction.

# article_158_job-and-role-change-turnover-trends-from-2023

{'title': 'Job and Role Change Turnover Trends from 2023', 'introduction': 'In the ever-evolving landscape of the investment management industry, where the dynamics of jobs and opportunities are constantly in flux, keeping a pulse on industry turnover becomes not just insightful, but imperative. Dakota Marketplace, with its finger firmly on the pulse of the industry, has become a treasure trove of data, providing a glimpse into the most significant changes. In 2023 alone, we tracked and recorded over 900 job and role changes across various channels within the investment management industry. It’s important to note that this data isn’t just numbers; it’s a reflection of the nature of the investment management world. Changes in jobs and roles within these channels highlight shifting trends, emerging opportunities, and the challenges professionals face in navigating their careers. Industry turnover is quite frequent, given the competitive landscape and the constant push for innovation and growth. However, this environment also presents a unique challenge: the difficulty of transitioning into new roles and firms within the sector. Recognizing this gap, Dakota Talent seeks to bridge this divide.This specialized job board is meticulously designed for investment management professionals, providing them with an exclusive platform to explore new opportunities, connect with potential employers, and seamlessly transition into their next roles. Dakota Talent is more than a job board; it’s a testament to our commitment to making the life of fundraisers easier within the investment management community. In this article we are going to review the channels with the most investment management industry turnover, and let you know where most of these individuals relocated after seeking a new job. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of the job change trends we saw in 2023. 1. RIAs From the 900 job and role changes we tracked in Dakota Marketplace last year, we discovered 242 people left RIAs. From this, it’s important to note that 164 of these people joined other RIAs. This could be for several reasons, but one we have said time and time again; the RIA channel is one you want to be in. With endless opportunities and new ideas, RIAs are a rich channel. The other most popular channels people went to after leaving RIAs were broker-dealers with 15 people, followed by 11 people joining banks. 2. Consultants Moving onto the second channel with the highest number of job changes is consultants, with 101 people leaving. Another notable point is 37 of these investment professionals went to other consultant firms. Following this, 13 people joined RIAs, 9 joined broker-dealers, 7 joined public pension funds, and 7 joined banks. 3. Investment Firms The third highest channel with the most job changes is investment firms with 73 people having left. Of these 73 people, we saw 20 join RIAs, 10 join broker-dealers, and 9 join family offices. 4. Public Pension Funds Moving onto the fourth highest channel we saw the most job changes from Dakota Marketplace in is public pension funds, with 66 people leaving. 37 of these people left pensions to relocate to other public pension funds, and 5 people joined consultant firms. 5. Banks Lastly, we saw a lot of movement within the bank channel. In Dakota Marketplace we tracked 60 total people leaving banks, with 21 of those joining other banks. Also to note, 10 of these people joined broker-dealers and 8 joined RIAs. What does this mean? Now, you may be wondering what conclusions can be drawn from this data on job changes from 2023. One important thing to note is we saw the majority of people leaving specific investment channels to join another firm within the same channel. This could be due to preferences, relations, specialties, etc. Secondly, a whopping total of over 900 job and role changes were recorded in Dakota Marketplace for 2023. That is a lot of turnover within the investment industry! While it’s impossible to predict the most popular and desirable channels to work in, the investment management industry is a real gift to be a part of. The constant turnover we have referenced throughout this article shows there are a lot of people who return to other channels because it is such an amazing industry to be a part of. Raising capital is extremely difficult, not to mention for an investment firm to find the right people to focus on the right channels for a specific strategy is not easy. Throw in market volatility, and in some cases a lack of money in motion, investment firms get frustrated and can be quick to pull the trigger on sales people. This leads to the need for ease of finding job opportunities or openings. Dakota Talent solves this as it is a job board designed specifically for investment management professionals.

# article_033_dakota-february-2025-new-private-funds-tracker

{'title': 'Dakota February 2025 New Private Funds Tracker', 'introduction': 'In the month of February, Dakota tracked approximately $27B in fresh fundraising targeted for private equity – inclusive of buyouts, growth equity, and venture capital – and roughly $12B in new raises launched or planned for private credit funds. Notably, these estimates only include traditional closed-end, private institutional funds, and so do not account for the growing number of continuously-offered “evergreen” funds targeting private wealth investors. Among the more notable developments on that front, TPG announced plans to launch a new evergreen private equity vehicle along with its second GP-led secondaries fund in support of a $30B+ fundraising target for 2025. Swedish global manager EQT also launched a new evergreen infrastructure strategy, and Antares Capital debuted a private credit fund, both of which will be available to private wealth investors. Home equity fintech Nada also debuted what it says is a first-of-its kind fund providing professional and wealthy investors with exposure to the $35T US home equity market.

# article_318_6-tips-for-taking-your-video-or-webinar-presentati

{'title': '6 Tips for Taking Your Video or Webinar Presentation to the Next Level', 'introduction': 'Even after two years on Zoom, we’ve all had moments where presenting or sharing on video has felt clunky. You’re likely already doing something you’re nervous about, with a “room” full of silent eyes on you — it can feel like a lot of pressure. But, whether you’re well-versed in video or new to it, there’s always room for improvement. At Dakota, we have a dedicated, in-house video team that creates world class video not just for our own team (though of course they do that, too!), but for our clients and non-profits, as well. Since the launch of Dakota Studios in early 2021, we’ve hammered out all the rough patches, and shot hours and hours of footage. Which is why, in this article, we’re sharing 7 video best practices you can put to use the next time you’re on a video call, meeting, or webinar. If you\'re in the investment management industry, you\'ve already heard us talk about the importance of keeping your audience informed through quarterly webinars. By the end of the article, you’ll have actionable changes you’ll be able to put into place before your next presentation or webinar. 1. Use the rules of composition People tend to think of these rules only when taking a photo, but those same rules can be applied to video as well. Make sure that your eyes and the center of your face are a third of the way up on the screen to best incorporate the rule of thirds. This will center you and make sure that you are in focus throughout the duration of your presentation. 2. Lighting is crucial We’re all working with what we have on hand, but the fact is that people are actually secondary to lighting. That’s how important it is. If you’re going to be doing webinars quarterly, or with any level of regularity, it could be beneficial to invest in something like a Lume Cube, which will provide you with high quality lighting designed for laptops and other smaller screens, along with a tripod to balance it on. 3. Use Zoom\'s settings to your advantage Within Zoom itself, you have plenty of setting options that will help maximize your appearance and video quality. Some of these include: “mirror my video”, “touch up my appearance”, and “adjust for low light.” 4. Make sure your audio settings are high-quality This is another case where Zoom is your friend, and includes helpful settings that you can take advantage of. These settings include: Ensure that high-fidelity music mode checked off if you’re playing music and to have better quality sound. Echo cancellation: his will get rid of any echoing that may be occurring. Stereo audio: This setting helps it sound better if people have stereo speakers Music and Professional Audio. This setting comes in handy if you\'re doing a webinar or live event, and will be sharing something with high quality music. 5. Give yourself a clear, clean background When you\'re presenting or sharing important information, the last thing you want is for people to be distracted by something behind you. To combat this you can: Add your own background Upload a video background that has motion in the back Blur your background 6. Record and save your webinar or presentation for later If you\'re sharing information that will be needed again, or will be distributed to a wider group later, you\'ll be happy you made your presentation as high-quality as you did, but you should also make sure that you\'re recording it properly so that it can be shared. To do this: Record a separate audio file of each participant. This can be beneficial when you have many people on a call Always click "optimize for third party video editor."

# article_304_the-top-10-owners-of-bank-loan-etfs-in-2022

{'title': 'The Top 10 Owners of Bank Loan ETFs in 2022', 'introduction': 'The bond market has not had a consistent trend over the past year, which has created a challenging environment for allocators, leaving many asking, “what should I do with fixed income, duration, rates, credit” entering 2022. Looking at the 13F flow data we collected over Q1, the answer has partially revealed itself as during the last two quarters as investors /allocators have seen a significant shift in where yields, the fed, and inflation 2021 ended Q4 2021, and where they are today. Post the introduction of QE, we saw allocators making two decisions as they constructed bond allocation: where to get income, and what is going to be the ballast/air bag that is not correlated to risk asset drawdowns. Now, with a few quarters of flow data, we were able to see how these decisions were being made and track trends in allocations, additions, and reductions in exposure. In this article, we’re going to be sharing some of the 13F trends we’ve seen along the yield curve so far this year, as well as the top 10 holders of bank loan and variable rate ETFs in 2022. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear understanding of the variable rate ETF landscape. First, we’ll jump into the trends. Observed 13F trends along the yield curve During the quarter, the yield curve moved higher causing core bonds to sell off almost 6%  during and high yield bonds drop 5%...concurrently we saw a reduction among the ETFs and CEFs during this past qtr, in particular in where duration played a role such as intermediate term bonds, where flows dropped 7% QoQ, and high yield dropped 11% QoQ. In aggregate, money was in motion under the surface as we saw those redemptions find their way into other areas within bond sub-asset classes to take advantage of the yield curve shift that we have seen since the beginning of the year and look for income on the front end of the curve. Unlike the last hiking cycle which was widely telegraphed and gave allocators time, this one is creating very swift directional flows into the front end of the curve. During Q1, this heavily favored floating/ variable rate and shorter duration vehicles via three main sub-asset classes: Bank loans/leveraged loans/CLOS: These are below investment-grade, senior secured corporate loans that have floating rate coupons linked to the LIBOR, typically 200 – 400 basis points over SOFR/LIBOR. They exhibit a very low duration and historically have shown positive correlation with inflation and negative correlation with U.S. Treasuries. For the past three quarters now, we have seen an increase of 10% in net asset flow for each quarter and points to interest rate aversion driving allocation decisions rather than risk aversion. For a great resource on the asset class, MP member Eaton Vance publishes an informative quarterly update. Floating rate notes: Similar to bank loans, these have near-zero duration risk, and floating coupons. Unlike bank loans, however, they are issued by investment-grade rated companies with lower credit risk, thus lowering the risk of default, but a lower yield as well: typically 25-100 basis points over LIBOR/SOFR. These are different from bank loans, as BlackRock noted in a recent piece. Ultra Short and Short Duration These typically invest in investment grade bonds with fixed rates and fixed maturities.  Ultra short strategies will keep their duration at one year or below, and short duration will focus on a one- to three-year maturity range. Over the course of this most recent quarter, the filings showed a 16% increase in asset flow into these two categories combined. In a recent piece, PIMCO illustrated the characteristics and differences between these categories. The common theme among all of these sub-asset classes is that they remain well placed to deal with the current environment through the combination of their low duration sensitivity, helping to protect against rising bond yields, and a reasonably attractive coupon level that will help mitigate the income erosion effect from inflation. Finally, as we continue to compile and update this information into our database, Dakota Marketplace, another trend we saw during the quarter was ongoing conversion from mutual funds to ETFs. This year already saw six firms covering sixteen funds have converted with another seven funds on deck. Below is a sampling of allocators who had positions in these asset classes as reported at the end of Q1 2022. Yield Curve Graphic showing the change in yields from Q4 21-Q1 2022: Now that you’ve got a good understanding of what we’re seeing in the market, we’ll get into the top ten owners of bank loan ETFs in 2022.

If you’re ready to learn more, we’d love to offer you a free trial of Dakota Marketplace.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'The Top 10 Owners of Bank Loan ETFs in 2022', 'content': 'The bond market has not had a consistent trend over the past year, which has created a challenging environment for allocators, leaving many asking, “what should I do with fixed income, duration, rates, credit” entering 2022. Looking at the 13F flow data we collected over Q1, the answer has partially revealed itself as during the last two quarters as investors /allocators have seen a significant shift in where yields, the fed, and inflation 2021 ended Q4 2021, and where they are today. Post the introduction of QE, we saw allocators making two decisions as they constructed bond allocation: where to get income, and what is going to be the ballast/air bag that is not correlated to risk asset drawdowns. Now, with a few quarters of flow data, we were able to see how these decisions were being made and track trends in allocations, additions, and reductions in exposure. In this article, we’re going to be sharing some of the 13F trends we’ve seen along the yield curve so far this year, as well as the top 10 holders of bank loan and variable rate ETFs in 2022. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear understanding of the variable rate ETF landscape. First, we’ll jump into the trends. Observed 13F trends along the yield curve During the quarter, the yield curve moved higher causing core bonds to sell off almost 6%  during and high yield bonds drop 5%...concurrently we saw a reduction among the ETFs and CEFs during this past qtr, in particular in where duration played a role such as intermediate term bonds, where flows dropped 7% QoQ, and high yield dropped 11% QoQ. In aggregate, money was in motion under the surface as we saw those redemptions find their way into other areas within bond sub-asset classes to take advantage of the yield curve shift that we have seen since the beginning of the year and look for income on the front end of the curve. Unlike the last hiking cycle which was widely telegraphed and gave allocators time, this one is creating very swift directional flows into the front end of the curve. During Q1, this heavily favored floating/ variable rate and shorter duration vehicles via three main sub-asset classes: Bank loans/leveraged loans/CLOS: These are below investment-grade, senior secured corporate loans that have floating rate coupons linked to the LIBOR, typically 200 – 400 basis points over SOFR/LIBOR. They exhibit a very low duration and historically have shown positive correlation with inflation and negative correlation with U.S. Treasuries. For the past three quarters now, we have seen an increase of 10% in net asset flow for each quarter and points to interest rate aversion driving allocation decisions rather than risk aversion. For a great resource on the asset class, MP member Eaton Vance publishes an informative quarterly update. Floating rate notes: Similar to bank loans, these have near-zero duration risk, and floating coupons. Unlike bank loans, however, they are issued by investment-grade rated companies with lower credit risk, thus lowering the risk of default, but a lower yield as well: typically 25-100 basis points over LIBOR/SOFR. These are different from bank loans, as BlackRock noted in a recent piece. Ultra Short and Short Duration These typically invest in investment grade bonds with fixed rates and fixed maturities.  Ultra short strategies will keep their duration at one year or below, and short duration will focus on a one- to three-year maturity range. Over the course of this most recent quarter, the filings showed a 16% increase in asset flow into these two categories combined. In a recent piece, PIMCO illustrated the characteristics and differences between these categories. The common theme among all of these sub-asset classes is that they remain well placed to deal with the current environment through the combination of their low duration sensitivity, helping to protect against rising bond yields, and a reasonably attractive coupon level that will help mitigate the income erosion effect from inflation. Finally, as we continue to compile and update this information into our database, Dakota Marketplace, another trend we saw during the quarter was ongoing conversion from mutual funds to ETFs. This year already saw six firms covering sixteen funds have converted with another seven funds on deck. Below is a sampling of allocators who had positions in these asset classes as reported at the end of Q1 2022.

# article_252_second-half-of-february-ria-and-financial-advisor

{'title': 'Second Half of February RIA and Financial Advisor Moves and Acquisitions', 'introduction': 'Wrapping up February the wire house channel became more active as recruiting picked up.   On a specific firm level, many of the same trends that existed during 2022 continued this month mainly: Morgan Stanley continued to be the wire house leader as attractive 300-350% signing deals are offered, and Merrill losing the most FAs. Merrill does continue to fill out their retail bank branches with salary/commission structures and attract younger/next Generation advisors. For an asset manager, this will make the relationship with the Merrill home office approval lists all that more important with many of the branch based FAs using firm models. Independents: Christopher Matheson in Glendora, CA, Todd Clarke based in Gilbert, AZ, and Thomas "Ryan" Leggett in Midlothian, VA  have all joined Totus Wealth Management, who partner with Cetera. Together the three FAs are bringing $610 M AUM with them.  The three used to clear through OneAmerica Securities.  Totus’s main office is located in Houston, TX. H.L. Wiginton Capital Management led by Mike Wiginton in Jasper, AL managing $220 has joined Steward Partners.  This is the first team that Steward is boarding using the Pershing platform post the Raymond James separation. Also joining Steward Partners is Clarity Private Wealth Solutions (former Team name Ferguson Bailey Private Wealth Management Group) led by John N. Ferguson and Charles B. Bailey in Mobile, AL with $250 M AUM.  The Clarity team was previously with Wells Fargo.  This is the fourth Team to join Steward in 2023 and has been one of the fastest growing RIAs since launch in 2013 and consistently has a many FAs listed on the Forbes Shook Best in State lists. Phillip Knight and Amy Lawler based in the heart of Texas oil country in Midland, TX managing $715 M AUM have joined Americana Partners.  The move was centered on the client base that they serve being heavily tied to the energy sector, and they felt larger firms were shying away from the oil and gas industry as the Team was previously with Morgan Stanley.  Americana has added additional Morgan Stanley talent over the years including MS CIO David Darst. Schwinck Private Wealth led by Karl Schwinck and John McCloskey based in Denver, CO managing $500 AUM has joined Ashton Thomas Private Wealth.  This will bring Ashton Thomas AUM to $2B AUM.  The Team was previously with Wells. Jeff Steiner and Tim Durbin based in St. Louis, MO managing $1 B AUM have joined Private Wealth Asset Management.

While not an acquisition per se, Commonwealth Financial Network has announced that it will transition the firm away from being an independent BD, into a mega- RIA that also maintains a BD platform.  Commonwealth currently has $243 B AUM as they exited a record 2022 in recruits. One of the larger news events of the month was the decision of Focus Financial to go private as they were purchased by Clayton, Dubilier & Rice.  Focus stated this will enable them to continue their acquisition strategy and further add to the 73 RIA stable they have amassed. Walker Wealth led by Craig Walker based in Fullerton, CA managing $301 M AUM has been purchased by Mariner Wealth Advisors.  Walker focuses on working with medical professionals.

On a specific firm level, many of the same trends that existed during 2022 continued this month mainly: Morgan Stanley continued to be the wire house leader as attractive 300-350% signing deals are offered, and Merrill losing the most FAs. Merrill does continue to fill out their retail bank branches with salary/commission structures and attract younger/next Generation advisors. For an asset manager, this will make the relationship with the Merrill home office approval lists all that more important with many of the branch based FAs using firm models. Independents: Christopher Matheson in Glendora, CA, Todd Clarke based in Gilbert, AZ, and Thomas "Ryan" Leggett in Midlothian, VA  have all joined Totus Wealth Management, who partner with Cetera. Together the three FAs are bringing $610 M AUM with them.  The three used to clear through OneAmerica Securities.  Totus’s main office is located in Houston, TX. H.L.

Phillip Knight and Amy Lawler based in the heart of Texas oil country in Midland, TX managing $715 M AUM have joined Americana Partners.

Americana has added additional Morgan Stanley talent over the years including MS CIO David Darst. Schwinck Private Wealth led by Karl Schwinck and John McCloskey based in Denver, CO managing $500 AUM has joined Ashton Thomas Private Wealth.  This will bring Ashton Thomas AUM to $2B AUM.

# article_059_family-offices-a-growing-opportunity-for-emerging

{'title': 'Family Offices: A Growing Opportunity for Emerging Managers', 'introduction': 'Emerging managers often face the challenge of growing their businesses on limited budgets, and Dakota’s Emerging Manager Growth Show is designed specifically to help. Hosted by Dakota’s CEO and Founder, Gui Costin, the show offers practical advice on how managers can do more with less. Each episode focuses on a different institutional channel such as RIAs, pension funds, family offices, banks and broker-dealers or consultants, and provides actionable tips on scaling, best practices, and navigating industry trends. The goal is to equip emerging managers with the tools needed to thrive in a competitive landscape. This past October, the Emerging Manager Growth Show focused on the Family Office channel with Gui Costin and Tim Dolan sharing their insights on why the RIA space is ideal for emerging managers. They offer strategies for successful outreach, including the importance of consistency, leveraging webinars, and capitalizing on RIAs of all sizes. In this article, we will cover the key takeaways from October’s Emerging Manager Growth Show. By the end of this, you’ll have actionable tips to help you navigate the Family Office channel and grow your business. Key Takeaways 1. Family Offices Present a Prime Market for Emerging Managers Family offices have expanded rapidly, driven by the wealth generated from private equity, private credit, and other alternative investments. Many of these are first-generation family offices that are actively seeking unique and interesting investment ideas. Nearly half of family office portfolios are typically allocated to alternatives, making this a fertile space for newer managers with specialized strategies. 2. Cold Outreach is Non-Negotiable For emerging managers, cold outreach is essential to build initial connections with family offices. Costin and Dolan stress the importance of consistency and discipline, recommending that managers send 20–25 targeted emails daily and organize outreach by city. While cold outreach can be daunting, persistence in this area can bring valuable relationships and lead to significant growth. 3. Quarterly Webinars: Strengthen Relationships and Build Trust Consistent quarterly webinars are a cost-effective way for managers to stay engaged with clients and prospects. At Dakota, we recommend video-based webinars that provide performance updates, market insights, and showcase the faces behind the fund. This strategy helps build trust and familiarity over time. In addition, they stress the importance of using the webinars for marketing with follow-up emails, transcripts, and recaps to maximize engagement. New call-to-action 4. Leverage a CRM for Organization and Efficiency A CRM system is indispensable for managing outreach and keeping track of contacts and meetings. “If it’s not in the CRM, it doesn’t exist,” Costin emphasized throughout this segment. By logging all interactions, emerging managers can streamline follow-ups, track past activities, and maintain organized records that help keep their outreach efficient and impactful. 5. In-Person Meetings Are Key to Building Stronger Connections While virtual meetings have become more common, face-to-face interactions remain crucial. Dolan shared his experience with in-person meetings, noting that they bring stronger relationship-building results compared to virtual ones. Emerging managers should prioritize live meetings with family offices to build deeper trust and rapport. 6. Ask the Tough Questions to Gauge Interest At the end of each meeting, Costin recommends asking two questions to determine interest and next steps: “Does this strategy fit within your portfolio?” “Do you anticipate conducting a search in the next 12 months?” If the answer is positive, managers can explore specific timelines and next steps. These direct questions help clarify the potential for collaboration and ensure that any necessary follow-up is well-targeted. 7. Attend Key Conferences for Family Offices Industry conferences remain invaluable for networking and visibility. Costin highlighted upcoming conferences such as HedgeWeek, Opel, and the SEM Consortium as ideal events for meeting family offices and building connections. Attending these events, even informally, can provide emerging managers with insight into family office preferences and expand their networks in a targeted manner. Embrace the Opportunity in Family Offices Family offices are a rapidly growing market segment, and emerging managers have a unique chance to make inroads by focusing on this channel. Cold outreach, consistent engagement through webinars, and a well-managed CRM can help establish a strong presence in this growing space. Costin and Dolan’s advice provides a roadmap for emerging managers eager to expand their reach and find success within the family office market. The Emerging Manager Growth Show continues to serve as a valuable resource for emerging managers, equipping them with the tools and strategies needed to thrive.

{'title': 'Dakota Live! Alts Call Public Pension Summary', 'introduction': "Summary of November public pension plan commitment summary points: This was the first time in a few months we saw yields decline across all fixed income sub sectors, especially credit sensitive areas with floating rate/CLO/variable rate/private credit structures as some of the best performing areas. The public equity markets also saw toned down volatility, and continued price improvement. Public pension funded ratio index saw a meaningful improvement increasing from 70% in October to 75% in November. November we saw 158 individual commitments totaling $20.1 B allocated among managers.  This compares to 90 commitments made last month which was below the average seen during through the year.  43 individual pension funds made commitments during November. The top allocators in the month were: California Public Employees' Retirement Systems allocating $8,942,000 New York State Teachers Retirement System allocating $1,600,000 Florida State Board of Administration allocating $1,307,000 Asset Classes- building on a trend from last month when looking at asset classes, Private Equity had been allocated the most top asset class at 29% of commitments, with Private Credit further closing the gap with 25%, and Private Real Estate with 18%.

# article_360_a-step-by-step-guide-to-accessing-emerging-manager

{'title': 'A Step-by-Step Guide to Accessing Emerging Manager Programs at Public Pensions', 'introduction': "It’s never easy launching a new strategy at a new firm, especially when approaching potential allocators. It can be overwhelming knowing who to call, doing the outreach, and following up. This is why we wanted to provide some insights on the Public Pension channel that can be a great resource to help launch your strategy. Pensions have increasingly grown their allocations over the years, and not only help younger firms and managers, but it is really in hope to find future managers they can trust for a long time to come. So, with that being said, it’s important to have the “road map” on how to navigate these larger pensions with Emerging Manager programs that can be daunting at first glance. In this case, we would like to provide you the “road map” to the two largest pensions in New York: New York City Comptroller’s Office and New York State Common Fund. Every pension defines an Emerging Manager differently, even within their own program by asset class. So in this article, you will find the following: How is their Emerging Manager Program organized? Is my strategy a fit based off of Firm AUM or Fund AUM, vintage, etc? Who are the consultants that cover my respective asset class (if any)? Although your strategy might seem like a fit at first glance, it can be a long, grueling process to eventually get the winning ticket. The Due Diligence process can be time consuming and intense, but establishing that relationship and persistence is key. By the end of this article, you'll have a clear understanding of the New York public pension Emerging Manager programs, as well as their requirements. New York City Comptroller Office The NYC Comptroller Office manages five different pensions for the city (Teacher Retirement System, Employees Retirement System, Police, Fire, and Board of Education), so we are laying out the consultants for each asset class per pension because the boards pick different consultants for different asset classes. Also, each asset class defines emerging manager differently, so this is a good example of not all Emerging Manager programs are created equal. Public Markets: TRS - Rocaton NYCERS - Callan POLICE - Wilshire FIRE - New England Pension Consultant BERS - Segal Marco Criteria: Managers are generally limited to under $2 billion of firm-wide assets under management at time of initial funding. Private Equity: TRS - Hamilton Lane NYCERS - StepStone POLICE - StepStone FIRE - StepStone BERS - N/A Criteria: Primarily Funds I – III, raising up to $1 billion with a broad institutional investor base. Buyout, growth equity, and distressed/special situations investment strategies. Firms with institutional-quality middle and back offices and strong operational controls. Real Estate: TRS - Courtland (StepStone) NYCERS - Courtland (StepStone) POLICE - Townsend FIRE - Townsend BERS - Courtland (StepStone) Criteria: Firms with less than $2 billion in total assets under management. Currently raising first, second, or third institutional real estate fund. Currently targeting fund size of $500 million or less. Opportunistic Fixed Income: TRS - Rocaton NYCERS - Callan POLICE - Wilshire FIRE - New England Pension BERS - Segal Marco This sleeve is looking at long-biased, alternative credit investment strategies such as direct lending, special situations, distressed, commercial real estate debt and structured credit. Criteria: Firms that are currently fundraising between $500 million and $2 billion. Have a broad institutional investor base. Employ complementary strategies to the existing portfolio. Hedge Funds: Not as large as the other programs but still important to note. TRS - N/A NYCERS - N/A POLICE - Aksia FIRE - Aksia BERS - N/A Criteria: Firms with less than $1 billion in assets under management and/or less than a 3-year track record at time of funding. Discretionary and systematic macro, commodities, credit, long/short equity, event driven, tactical trading, relative value strategies and focus on low net exposure funds. New York State Common Fund The pension defines emerging managers by stages of their life cycle as a firm, and there is different coverage depending on that stage that we wanted to lay out for you and your firm. It’s also worth noting that in addition to their Emerging Manager program, they also have a Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprise Program that manages over $20B. The criteria here is pretty much firms that are majority owned by women or minority managers that have established a trackable track record, and have their operations sound. This has been a huge emphasis for New York, and will be moving forward. Public Equities: Global Equity: Xponance (previously FIS Group) US Small Cap: Leading Edge Investment Advisors US Mid Cap, Global Equity: RockCreek Criteria: Early & Mid-Stage: Structure: Separate Managed Account Managed by: Program Partners Firm AUM typically less than $500 million (early) and $2 billion (mid) at the time of commitment.

In this case, we would like to provide you the “road map” to the two largest pensions in New York: New York City Comptroller’s Office and New York State Common Fund. Every pension defines an Emerging Manager differently, even within their own program by asset class. So in this article, you will find the following: How is their Emerging Manager Program organized? Is my strategy a fit based off of Firm AUM or Fund AUM, vintage, etc? Who are the consultants that cover my respective asset class (if any)? Although your strategy might seem like a fit at first glance, it can be a long, grueling process to eventually get the winning ticket. The Due Diligence process can be time consuming and intense, but establishing that relationship and persistence is key. By the end of this article, you'll have a clear understanding of the New York public pension Emerging Manager programs, as well as their requirements. New York City Comptroller Office The NYC Comptroller Office manages five different pensions for the city (Teacher Retirement System, Employees Retirement System, Police, Fire, and Board of Education), so we are laying out the consultants for each asset class per pension because the boards pick different consultants for different asset classes. Also, each asset class defines emerging manager differently, so this is a good example of not all Emerging Manager programs are created equal. Public Markets: TRS - Rocaton NYCERS - Callan POLICE - Wilshire FIRE - New England Pension Consultant BERS - Segal Marco Criteria: Managers are generally limited to under $2 billion of firm-wide assets under management at time of initial funding. Private Equity: TRS - Hamilton Lane NYCERS - StepStone POLICE - StepStone FIRE - StepStone BERS - N/A Criteria: Primarily Funds I – III, raising up to $1 billion with a broad institutional investor base. Buyout, growth equity, and distressed/special situations investment strategies. Firms with institutional-quality middle and back offices and strong operational controls. Real Estate: TRS - Courtland (StepStone) NYCERS - Courtland (StepStone) POLICE - Townsend FIRE - Townsend BERS - Courtland (StepStone) Criteria: Firms with less than $2 billion in total assets under management. Currently raising first, second, or third institutional real estate fund. Currently targeting fund size of $500 million or less. Opportunistic Fixed Income: TRS - Rocaton NYCERS - Callan POLICE - Wilshire FIRE - New England Pension BERS - Segal Marco This sleeve is looking at long-biased, alternative credit investment strategies such as direct lending, special situations, distressed, commercial real estate debt and structured credit. Criteria: Firms that are currently fundraising between $500 million and $2 billion. Have a broad institutional investor base. Employ complementary strategies to the existing portfolio. Hedge Funds: Not as large as the other programs but still important to note. TRS - N/A NYCERS - N/A POLICE - Aksia FIRE - Aksia BERS - N/A Criteria: Firms with less than $1 billion in assets under management and/or less than a 3-year track record at time of funding. Discretionary and systematic macro, commodities, credit, long/short equity, event driven, tactical trading, relative value strategies and focus on low net exposure funds. New York State Common Fund The pension defines emerging managers by stages of their life cycle as a firm, and there is different coverage depending on that stage that we wanted to lay out for you and your firm. It’s also worth noting that in addition to their Emerging Manager program, they also have a Minority and Women Owned Business Enterprise Program that manages over $20B. The criteria here is pretty much firms that are majority owned by women or minority managers that have established a trackable track record, and have their operations sound. This has been a huge emphasis for New York, and will be moving forward.

# article_363_7-trends-driving-alternative-investments-in-rias-a

{'title': '7 Trends Driving Alternative Investments in RIAs and MFOs', 'introduction': 'If you’re in the Alternative investment industry and wonder if calling on the RIA channel is worth the effort, you’re not alone. Plenty of investment sales people have the same debate, and spend a lot of their time wondering whether or not they should invest the time needed to understand the complexity of the RIA channel. We get it. The RIA market is extremely difficult to penetrate because of fragmentation and breadth across the country. For example, in our database, Marketplace, there are over 1,100 qualified RIAs across the country, which is a lot to cover, and can be an overwhelming exercise for anyone. However, at Dakota, we’ve been fundraising since 2006, and we’ve found success in calling on the RIA channel, and we believe you can too. In fact, one of the biggest and most frequently asked questions that we hear: “I sell alternative investment strategies, is it worth my time selling to RIAS?” Our answer to this is always “yes.” In this article we’re going to unpack the trends driving the adoption of strategies within RIAS and the multi-family office community. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear idea of just how lucrative the RIA channel can be for your team and your firm. 1. Technology makes RIAs more accessible Updates  and advancement of technology within the asset management industry have enabled access to alternative strategies making the whole investment and subscription experience easier — the whole RIA ecosystem is being built out where products can be scaled in a more fluid investor experience. Some of these technologies include: iCapital and CAIS have built out platforms that offer lower minimum investments for clients Docusign has made the subscription process easier because it allows paperwork to be signed without the long, clunky process many of us have gotten used to over the years. Now that this technology is in place, these things are a lot simpler, getting things signed and getting the investment. 2. The banking system is becoming more conservative The reality is that the banking system is becoming conservative in underwriting standards, which has created the opportunity for capital to fill the void once occupied by traditional bank lending. Investment strategies like direct lending, structured finance , and other financing strategies are becoming mainstream Private capital is spawning these strategies so opportunities are shifting from the banking system into private lending strategies. Macro forces like extremely low yields are driving investor demand for strategies that can provide liquidity and cash flow once provided by core fixed income. 3. Alternatives offer an “alternative” to fixed income strategies and hedge equity risk Due diligence analysts at RIA’s have the same concerns as institutional analysts.  How do I generate yield for my clients and how do I hedge equity market risk? These two concerns can be addressed through the many investment strategies and structures becoming more mainstream to the advisory community. 4. More product structures have made it easier for RIAs to access alternatives partnerships Recently there have been more and more product structures that have made it easier for RIAs to access alternatives. Alternative investments used to be in limited partnership vehicles only, making it very difficult for investors to meet investment minimums. Many strategies have investment merit for providing yield and downside protection.  Now we are seeing an opportunity set of more liquid structures like interval funds, tender offer funds, ETF’s , mutual funds and other liquid vehicles where advisory firms can make meaningful allocations to client portfolios. 5. Low interest rates and a desire for high yield Currently, there is a lot of demand for yield found within RIAs. For example, in a 60%/ 40%, the 40% is essentially earning you nothing. This means that RIAs have had to go out and find ways to earn 6-8% yield returns. This creates liquidity, and there’s demand because they need their clients to earn yield. 6. The competitive landscape within alternatives In a competitive landscape, an RIAs line up of alternative strategies can be a point of differentiation. While they do not offer a huge dispersion of returns for equity performance, the dispersion of returns in the interest and ideas can be in the alternative bucket, i.e.: yield, hedging equity, private equity, co-investments. We at Dakota have seen many advisory firms move quickly to enlist these strategies in portfolios to compete with other advisory firms to win client business Additionally, the RIA channel is the most underserved market for alternatives. The research teams inside these firms are very sophisticated and control trillions of dollars! Alternative asset management firms are realizing this and we have seen this through growth from subscriptions for Marketplace. 7. The convergence between due diligence analysts who used to work elsewhere who have started their own RIAS Over the last twenty years, there has been a very large convergence between the due diligence analysts who used to work at Consultants, Public Funds, Foundations, Endowments and other more institutional type firms, but now work at RIAs. These same analysts used to be heavily invested in alternatives, and are now bringing that alternative expertise to their RIA. A recent example is a large East Coast multi family office hired a CIO from a large P+C insurance company, a large southern bank hired a CIO from a leading foundation. These institutional CIO’s are porting over their alternative relationships to their new platforms The musical chairs of analysts moving around and bringing their expertise in alts to their RIA is great news for alternative investment managers. With 15% to 25% turnover amongst 1,100 RIAs means if they know you and like you they will take you with them to their next firm. Is the RIA channel right for your team? The short answer here is yes. Everything  mentioned above:  low interest rates, demand for yield, hedging equity risk, easier investor experience, lower minimums, institutional due diligence professionals moving to advisory platforms and technological advancements are creating a supernova of opportunity. If you’re marketing an alternative investment strategy, all the trends illustrate that marketing to the RIA channel is mandatory. At Dakota, it’s become very clear  there is massive growth from alternative asset management firms calling on advisory  firms that are increasing their allocations to alternative strategies.  This trend is growing due to more investor choice and utility in investment portfolios. Salespeople are having success and we believe this trend will continue.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': '7 Trends Driving Alternative Investments in RIAs and MFOs', 'content': 'If you’re in the Alternative investment industry and wonder if calling on the RIA channel is worth the effort, you’re not alone.

# article_003_city-scheduling-for-investment-sales-the-most-effe

{'title': 'City Scheduling for Investment Sales: The Most Effective Outreach Strategy You’re Not Using', 'introduction': 'In a world full of complex CRM systems, expensive lead generation tools, and AI-driven automation, the most powerful sales tactic we’ve ever used at Dakota is also one of the simplest: City Scheduling. It’s a tactic that brings structure to chaos, turns strategy into execution, and, most importantly, drives real results. If you’re in investment sales, you know how chaotic the calendar can get. You’re juggling outreach, meetings, travel, and often it feels like you’re just reacting. That’s where City Scheduling changes the game. What Is City Scheduling? City Scheduling is the practice of organizing your sales outreach and meetings by metro area, and executing a systematic outreach campaign to fill your calendar in that city. Instead of working a national list randomly, you bring order to the madness by focusing on one market at a time. You proactively book five meetings in one city for one day, then move on to the next city. Simple? Yes. It might sound simple. But trust me, it’s incredibly effective. Why City Scheduling Works Here’s why it’s so powerful: 1. It Shrinks the Problem Trying to call on 3,000 RIAs across the country is overwhelming. Calling on the 85 RIAs in Chicago? Totally doable. 2. It Creates a Repeatable System Instead of reactive outreach, you have a clear, structured playbook. Every week, you know what cities you’re scheduling for and what emails you’re sending. 3. It Keeps You Focused With five cities on your calendar at any given time, your outreach becomes targeted and intentional. You’re not bouncing around aimlessly. You’re executing a plan. 4. It Builds Market Awareness The more often you visit a city or reach out to a specific Metro Area, the more familiar your name becomes. Even if they don’t meet with you today, they remember you tomorrow. 5. It Fuels Your Pipeline City Scheduling fills your calendar with qualified meetings. That’s how you build momentum, drive pipeline, and raise capital. How to Do It: The Dakota City Scheduling Playbook Here’s the exact system we use: Step 1: Pick Your Cities Choose 5 cities based on the concentration of target accounts in your TAM. Step 2: Create Your Daily Schedule Block 5 meeting slots per day: 9:00 a.m. • 11:00 a.m. • 1:00 p.m. • 3:00 p.m. • 4:30 p.m. Step 3: Start Outreach 3–4 Weeks in Advance Send ~30 emails per day per city using a clear, concise meeting request (more on that below). Step 4: Work 5 Metro Areas at a Time While you’re filling meetings in one city, you’re prepping the next four behind the scenes. Step 5: Track Progress Use a CRM to track outreach, confirmations, and follow-ups. The Email That Books the Meeting Your email should be short, specific, and include a clear CTA. Here’s an example: Subject Line: Meeting Request – March 7 at 3:00 p.m. I’ll be in Boston on March 7 with my colleague Sarah Greene from Horizon Partners and would love to stop by and introduce our firm. Horizon manages $4B in a concentrated, high-conviction large cap strategy that’s outperformed its peer group since 2012. Would you be available to meet at 3:00 p.m.? That’s it. Clean. Focused. Effective. Even if they say no, they now know your name, your brand, and your strategy. Why It’s Not Micromanagement, It’s Leadership Sales leaders: your job is to help your team win. Requiring them to always have five cities on the calendar is not micromanagement. It’s accountability for activity. It’s the most practical way to ensure your team is consistently filling the top of the funnel. If they’re stuck, City Scheduling gets them unstuck. If they’re succeeding, City Scheduling scales their effort. Simplicity Wins City Scheduling works because it removes complexity. It gives you a system to follow every day, every week, every month. You’re not throwing darts at a map or waiting for leads to come in. You’re executing, moving with purpose, and filling your pipeline with high-fit prospects. In the end, City Scheduling isn’t just a sales tactic, it’s a mindset. A mindset of structure, discipline, and relentless execution. You want to raise more capital? Start here. Pick five cities. Block your calendar. Start the outreach. Then do it again. That’s how you build momentum.

# article_142_5-reasons-why-crms-are-vital-to-your-business

{'title': '5 Reasons Why CRMs are Vital to Your Business', 'introduction': 'In the fast-paced world of sales and distribution, staying organized and efficient is paramount. Enter the CRM system – a tool that has transformed the way businesses operate. We know there’s a lot of debate on the power of the CRM, in fact many don\'t necessarily believe in the leverage a salesperson can get out of a CRM. Dakota has been in the investment sales business since 2006 and raised over $30 billion, and we are here to tell you that CRM’s absolutely vital to your success. They are more than just digital Rolodexes; they are powerful tools that drive efficiency, improve client experiences, and enable strategic decision-making. A CRM allows your team to play at the highest professional level. You’d be doing your team a disservice if you don\'t hold them to account to manage the business out of the CRM. Whether you\'re a small firm questioning the need for a CRM or a large enterprise looking to optimize your current system, understanding the profound impact of a CRM is crucial. In this article we are reviewing five key leverage points a CRM offers your team, as well as the benefits all taken from investment sales leaders in the industry. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of the necessities to a CRM and why they are non-negotiable. 1. Prioritization and efficiency A CRM system is a powerful tool that significantly enhances prioritization and efficiency in investment sales. CRMs enable sales professionals to manage their daily tasks and goals more effectively, ensuring they focus on high-priority activities that drive success. More specifically, CRMs help salespeople prioritize their efforts by providing a structured approach to managing client interactions and tracking progress. With a detailed and thoughtful CRM system, salespeople can easily access their to-do lists, client histories, and upcoming meetings, allowing them to allocate their time and resources more efficiently. In addition, CRMs provide one click access to all contact information, meeting notes, and sales activities in a centralized system. This consolidation eliminates the chaos of juggling multiple spreadsheets and sticky notes, streamlining the sales process and reducing the risk of missed opportunities. By leveraging CRM data, sales teams can identify high-potential leads, track their progress, and ensure timely follow-ups. 2. Comprehensive operational insight A CRM system is invaluable for providing comprehensive operational insight in investment sales. They offer a holistic view of a firm\'s operations, allowing for better decision-making and strategic planning. Your CRM should enable sales leaders to understand what is happening across their entire organization. By aggregating data on sales activities, client interactions, and market trends, a CRM system provides a clear picture of overall performance. With the support of detailed reporting and analysis, regular activity and pipeline reports can be generated by CRMs. This assists sales teams to stay on top of their goals, identify trends, and make data-driven decisions. Ultimately, CRMs are providing complete transparency to sales operations. With all data centralized, it becomes easier to track key metrics, monitor the sales pipeline, and evaluate the effectiveness of different strategies. This visibility ensures that everyone, from individual salespeople to senior executives, has access to the same accurate information and are held accountable. 3. Accountability and transparency Building off of the point above, CRMs ensure that sales teams are operating with great accountability and transparency. In the words of many industry leaders, "if it\'s not in the CRM, it didn’t happen." This principle ensures that every interaction, meeting note, and sales activity is recorded, leaving no room for oversight. Salespeople are held accountable for their actions, and managers can easily track performance and follow up on pending tasks. With all data centralized, CRMs paint a clear view of the sales pipeline, allowing everyone in the organization to see the status of various deals and activities. This visibility helps identify bottlenecks, monitor progress, and ensure that everyone is aligned with the company\'s goals. Regular activity reports generated by CRMs keep all team members informed about each other’s work, promoting a culture of openness and collaboration. Furthermore, CRMs support better communication between sales teams and management. Detailed reports and dashboards offer executives real-time insights into sales performance, enabling informed decision-making and strategic planning. This level of transparency ensures that all team members are on the same page and working towards common objectives, ultimately driving success in investment sales. 4. Data integration and accessibility A CRM system plays a pivotal role in enhancing data integration and accessibility in investment sales by centralizing data. Sales teams can quickly retrieve contact information, track the history of interactions, and monitor the progress of deals. This enables salespeople to respond to client inquiries promptly and accurately, fostering stronger client relationships and increasing the likelihood of closing deals. Throw in the fact that many individuals track data in various sources, integrating all this data into your CRM consolidates all information. Trying to recall where you wrote something down or what excel sheet you marked something down on is completely eliminated. Consolidating client interactions, meeting notes, sales activities, and external data, CRMs provide a comprehensive view of each client and prospect. In addition, CRMs support real-time data updates and sharing. Whether a salesperson is in the office or on the go, they can access the latest information from the CRM, ensuring they always have the most current data at their fingertips. This capability is especially valuable in dynamic sales environments where timely and accurate information is crucial for making informed decisions. 5. Continuity and seamless transition Lastly, a CRM system is essential for ensuring continuity and seamless transitions in investment sales. When a salesperson leaves, all their interactions, notes, and activities are preserved within the CRM. This comprehensive record allows the new salesperson to quickly get up to speed, understanding the history and current status of each client relationship. This continuity is vital for maintaining client trust and ensuring that sales efforts are not disrupted by staff changes. In addition, CRMs enhance internal communication and coordination. Detailed records and regular updates within the CRM ensure that all team members are informed about ongoing activities and client interactions. This transparency means that even if a team member is unavailable, others can step in and provide consistent service to clients, maintaining the quality and continuity of client relationships. Why a CRM is a non-negotiable A CRM holds the key to unlocking the potential of your sales team, but only if leveraged correctly. It\'s not simply about adoption; it\'s about integration and using the system to its full advantage. By focusing on productivity and making your CRM an indispensable part of your sales strategy, you\'re not just keeping up with the times; you\'re setting the pace for success. Overall, a CRM system transforms how investment sales teams operate, providing them with the tools they need to stay organized, prioritize their tasks, and ultimately, achieve greater efficiency and success in their sales efforts. All of these key points combined will allow you and your team to run a smooth, effective sales process. Whether you’re getting started with a CRM today, or already have a CRM and want to enhance your data, the power of a well-integrated CRM system cannot be overstated. As demonstrated by the insights above, CRMs are indispensable tools for enhancing efficiency, accountability, and overall business success.

With our Salesforce App Integration, our members are able to access our curated Dakota Marketplace data directly within their Salesforce instance, providing them more incentive to use their CRM and work through fresh data.
