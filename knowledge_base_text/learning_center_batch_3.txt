# article_329_top-5-ria-firms-in-san-antonio

{'title': 'Top 5 RIA Firms in San Antonio', 'introduction': "If you're in investment sales, you likely already know that one of the biggest problems of selling to the RIA (Registered Investment Adviser) marketplace is the sheer size of it. The RIA market across the United States consists of over 36,000 firms, which means that while there are more than enough to choose from when looking for new clients, narrowing down the list to only those that allocate to outside managers is going to be key. Here at Dakota, we’ve raised over $6 billion from over 350 RIAs, and that has been possible because we qualify and curate our list to only RIAs that allocate to outside managers. In an effort to help narrow down the sheer size of the market, we’ve put together a list of the top 10 RIAs in each major metro area across the country. To determine our list, we looked for three things: An AUM above $200 million A dedicated analyst team An RIA that actively allocates capital to outside investment management firms We have qualified 5 RIAs with AUMs ranging from $3.6B to $115M in San Antonio that meet our criteria. Below are the top RIAs from that list. However, this is by no means a “best of” list, as there are so many high quality RIAs in San Antonio and around the country. We just wanted to give you a place to start. 1. Alamo Advisors AUM: $3,576,705,559 2. Sendero Wealth Management AUM: $1,800,385,944 In Sendero Wealth Management's words, their firm was created to serve you. Whether your needs are investment related, philanthropic or lean more toward business consulting and succession planning, they have the expertise to guide you. Their reputation of delivering personal attention and outstanding service is embodied in their high-client retention. 3. 1900 Wealth AUM: $1,320,449,977 From 1900 Wealth's website, they are wholly owned by Jefferson Bank. Since 1946, Jefferson Bank has operated with the attitude and principles of a Texas family business – because that’s exactly what it is. Jefferson Bank has been a strong part of the South Texas banking community for more than 75 years. It remains independent, locally-owned and ideally structured for convenient, personalized service. Today, the third-generation leadership is represented by A.J. “Jack” Lewis III, Steve C. Lewis, and Paul E. McSween III. 4. Aspireon AUM: $267,040,803 According to Aspireon, they deliver an advice centric, non-traditional wealth management experience. They're focused in raising the probability of success so their clients can pursue the things significant to them. 5. Glass Wealth Management AUM: $115,000,000 In Glass Wealth Management's own words, they provide investment services primarily for high-net-worth individuals, families, and related accounts. They're investors, not market timers. They design investment portfolios to endure throughout complete business cycles, through market peaks and troughs. Core to their investment approach is the belief that an investor must “know what you own and why you own it.” Hence, it is with deference to that mantra that a client portfolio seldom will hold any financial product. Their unwavering client focus, their size, and their location equip them to avoid the noise that often surrounds investment decisions and the financial industry.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'Top 5 RIA Firms in San Antonio', 'content': "If you're in investment sales, you likely already know that one of the biggest problems of selling to the RIA (Registered Investment Adviser) marketplace is the sheer size of it.

# article_055_why-quarterly-webinars-are-essential-for-asset-man

{'title': 'Why Quarterly Webinars Are Essential for Asset Managers', 'introduction': 'As an asset manager, you’re constantly navigating the delicate balance of driving performance while maintaining open, honest communication with clients. In an industry where transparency is key, finding effective ways to keep clients informed – beyond the typical emails or quarterly reports – can feel overwhelming. One solution that many managers, including our own clients we raise money for, have found transformative is the quarterly webinar – A unique opportunity to connect with clients, provide insights, and reinforce trust. At Dakota we’ve been fundraising since 2006, and have spent the last fifteen years working out the best ways to disseminate the information that is most critical to our clients. For us this has been the quarterly update webinars. In this article, we are giving you five reasons why hosting a quarterly webinar is essential for asset managers. By the end of this, you’ll understand why they are more than just a “nice-to-have”; that is, they’re a powerful tool for building relationships and enhancing your firm’s reputation in a genuine, impactful way. Build Consistency and Trust Hosting a quarterly webinar creates a dependable touchpoint that clients can look forward to each quarter, helping them feel confident that they’re always in the loop about their investments. This consistency is especially important during times of volatility when clients seek reassurance and insight into how their portfolios are being managed. Quarterly webinars offer a proactive way to address these concerns, reinforcing trust and demonstrating your commitment to transparent communication. Even when results may not be ideal, clients appreciate knowing where they stand and understanding your strategy for moving forward. Creating a Scalable Solution for Meaningful Engagement Managing relationships across a growing client base can be challenging, and quarterly webinars offer a practical solution. Instead of holding individual calls to update each client, you can reach a large audience at once, delivering a consistent message and allowing everyone to receive the same high-quality, timely information. Not only does this save valuable time, but it also creates opportunities for focused follow-up conversations. Many clients appreciate the chance to connect one-on-one after the webinar to dive deeper into specific questions or topics. New call-to-action Providing Timely and Transparent Updates Each quarter brings new developments – portfolio adjustments, shifts in market conditions, and strategic refinements. For clients, understanding the “why” behind these changes is invaluable. Quarterly webinars allow you to walk clients through these updates in real-time, explaining key portfolio moves, market trends, and performance drivers. This level of transparency not only fosters trust but also makes clients feel more connected to their investments and the thought process behind managing their portfolios. Enhancing Your Brand and Visibility Quarterly webinars also serve as a subtle yet powerful tool for brand-building. By consistently hosting these events, you establish a regular touchpoint that reinforces your firm’s expertise and reliability. Each invitation, live presentation, and follow-up email reminds clients and prospects alike of your commitment to keeping them informed. Recordings and summaries of these webinars can also be repurposed and shared, creating an on-demand library of insights that adds long-term value for clients. Whether it’s for clients who missed the live session or for prospective clients exploring your firm, these resources showcase your dedication to transparency and client education, positioning your firm as a trusted, go-to source for financial expertise. Creating Space for Real-Time Engagement One of the greatest benefits of quarterly webinars is the opportunity for real-time interaction. Clients can ask questions and receive immediate responses, which brings a personal touch that’s often missing in other forms of communication. When clients feel heard and have the chance to ask specific questions, it deepens their trust and connection with your firm. If you’re new to webinars, preparing a few “softball” questions in advance can help encourage participation and set a comfortable tone for Q&A. This direct engagement not only strengthens relationships but also creates a collaborative atmosphere that clients value, knowing their voices are genuinely heard and respected. The Lasting Impact of Quarterly Webinars Quarterly webinars go beyond simply “updating clients”. They offer a meaningful way to engage with clients, build trust, and enhance your firm’s brand. By creating a dependable rhythm of transparent communication, you reinforce your role as a trusted advisor and give clients confidence in your guidance. In an industry where trust and relationships are paramount, embracing quarterly webinars can set your firm apart, keeping clients informed, engaged, and connected in a way that truly matters. So if you haven’t yet started, now is the perfect time to take that first step.

# article_081_dakota-fund-tracker-week-of-9-23-2024

{'title': 'Dakota Fund Tracker | Week of 9-23-2024', 'introduction': 'The "New Funds Tracker" blog is your weekly roundup of newly launched funds in the market, based on Form D filings. This blog delivers critical insights into the latest trends within the investment landscape, offering a comprehensive overview of where capital is flowing and which sectors are gaining momentum. This week, several new funds have been launched, reflecting a wide range of asset classes and strategies. Below, we’ll discuss the trends across asset classes, industries, and geographic focus. In this article, we’ll give you a breakdown overview of these new funds, and a highlight into trends across asset classes and the industry. Asset class trends: Private Equity: Private equity continues to dominate the fundraising landscape, with a breadth of new funds launched this week. Key strategies trends include growth equity and secondaries. Growth equity focuses on expanding businesses, offering investors opportunities in high-growth sectors with scalable potential, while private equity secondary investments involve buying existing stakes in private equity funds or portfolios from original investors. Examples of these strategies include Level Equity Growth Partners VI, L.P. and Capital Dynamics TP Secondary 2024 LP. Additionally, co-investment private equity is also making a mark, with funds like Madison Capital Funding Co-Investment Fund LP focusing on direct co-investments. This strategy allows investors to participate directly in targeted deals alongside other institutional investors, often in sectors where they seek specific exposure, such as financial services and healthcare. Venture Capital: Venture capital is experiencing robust activity, with a significant portion of these funds focused on early-stage investments, highlighting continued investor confidence in startups and high-growth companies. Notably, the focus on technology remains strong, as firms target innovative business models that can disrupt traditional industries. For instance, multiple venture capital funds are seeking opportunities in FinTech, digital infrastructure, and artificial intelligence, which are driving the next wave of digital transformation. Early-stage venture funds are key to backing these innovative companies, and examples like American Century Venture Fund II, LP indicate that there is substantial interest in tapping into this high-potential market, despite its inherent risks. Private Real Estate: Private real estate has been demonstrating steady interest in the sector. The majority of these funds focus on value-add and co-investment real estate strategies, allowing investors to pursue opportunities in specific real estate projects while diversifying their portfolios. Stone Point Capital’s Trident X US Feeder Fund, L.P. exemplifies this trend, with a focus on sectors like healthcare and insurance, highlighting the continued attractiveness of real estate investments tied to these critical industries. Private Credit: Private credit remains a vital asset class, especially for investors seeking to capitalize on opportunities in the middle-market lending space. Funds like FS Senior Credit Fund II, L.P. continue to focus on structured lending and secured loans, targeting companies that require flexible financing solutions. In a rising interest rate environment, these credit strategies offer compelling opportunities for yield while managing risk through senior secured structures. Hedge Funds: Investors can expect exposure to more flexible, often higher-risk strategies aimed at capturing market inefficiencies. These funds are primarily focused on long/short equity strategies. One notable example is South River Asset Management. These strategies are providing alternative investment approaches that seek to generate returns uncorrelated with traditional markets. Private Infrastructure: Funds such as Brookfield Oaktree’s Catalytic Transition Fund are focusing on sectors like sustainable agriculture and infrastructure, which align with global trends around sustainability and food security. These funds are well-positioned to address the increasing demand for sustainable infrastructure solutions as governments and corporations commit to reducing carbon footprints and ensuring long-term environmental resilience. Industry trends: Energy: The energy sector has emerged as a focal point in this week\'s fund filings, with several funds prioritizing investments in energy-related projects. Capital Dynamics TP Secondary 2024 LP and Capital Dynamics Hollyport TP Primary 2024 LP are prime examples of funds that are heavily targeting the energy space. As the global transition toward renewable energy accelerates, funds are positioning themselves to capture opportunities in sustainable energy infrastructure and clean energy technologies. This trend highlights the sector’s resilience and growth potential as businesses and governments continue to invest in sustainability initiatives. Financial Services & Healthcare: Investment in financial services, healthcare, and insurance remains strong this week, particularly within private equity and growth equity strategies. Stone Point Capital’s Trident X US Feeder Fund, L.P. is one example of a fund that focuses on these industries, targeting sectors like financial services, healthcare, and real estate. Healthcare continues to attract substantial investor interest due to ongoing innovation and the growing demand for medical services, pharmaceuticals, and healthcare technology. Moreover, Madison Capital Funding Co-Investment Fund LP has a broad focus on financial services and healthcare, reflecting the increasing importance of these sectors in today\'s market. With healthcare innovation being a central theme, particularly after the global pandemic, investors are eager to capitalize on advancements in medical technologies, digital health solutions, and healthcare services. Technology: Technology remains a dominant industry for investment, with this week’s filings reflecting continued interest in areas such as FinTech, SaaS, and digital infrastructure. For example, American Century Venture Fund II, LP is heavily focused on technology-driven sectors, particularly in early-stage companies. These investments are aimed at supporting innovative businesses that have the potential to disrupt traditional industries, especially within financial technology and digital platforms. In addition, Capital Dynamics’ funds continue to invest in tech-related opportunities through growth equity strategies, underlining the importance of technology and digital transformation in the private equity space. This week’s filings underscore a clear preference for sectors that offer high scalability and recurring revenue models, particularly in software-driven businesses. Real Estate: Real estate remains a significant area of interest, especially with the rise of private real estate funds focusing on value-add and co-investment strategies. Stone Point Capital’s Trident X US Feeder Fund, L.P. provides exposure to real estate, further demonstrating the sector\'s resilience and its potential to generate steady returns. In particular, the healthcare and real estate sectors are closely intertwined, with several funds targeting healthcare-related real estate projects, reflecting the ongoing need for specialized facilities like hospitals and senior living centers. Geographic distribution: From a geographic perspective, North America continues to lead, particularly within the energy and private equity sectors. However, the global focus of several funds reflects an increasing desire for international diversification. Global strategies remain prevalent, with investors keen to capitalize on opportunities across both developed and emerging markets. Firms like Capital Dynamics and Stone Point Capital maintain a global investment outlook, with exposure to multiple regions such as North America, Europe, and beyond. This global perspective allows investors to balance regional risks and access growth markets outside the traditional confines of North American investments. Start leveraging these trends! This week’s new fund filings reflect the ongoing strength of private equity across various strategies, from co-investments to fund of funds. Sectors such as energy, financial services, and healthcare are seeing robust activity, as they present both resilience and growth potential in an evolving economic landscape. Venture capital remains an active space, with continued focus on early-stage, high-growth sectors. Geographically, the funds are maintaining a global approach, ensuring diverse exposure across multiple regions while maintaining a core focus on North America. As the market continues to adapt to economic and industry shifts, these trends suggest that investors are positioning themselves for both short-term resilience and long-term growth across a range of asset classes and industries.

These investments are aimed at supporting innovative businesses that have the potential to disrupt traditional industries, especially within financial technology and digital platforms. In addition, Capital Dynamics’ funds continue to invest in tech-related opportunities through growth equity strategies, underlining the importance of technology and digital transformation in the private equity space. This week’s filings underscore a clear preference for sectors that offer high scalability and recurring revenue models, particularly in software-driven businesses. Real Estate: Real estate remains a significant area of interest, especially with the rise of private real estate funds focusing on value-add and co-investment strategies. Stone Point Capital’s Trident X US Feeder Fund, L.P. provides exposure to real estate, further demonstrating the sector\'s resilience and its potential to generate steady returns. In particular, the healthcare and real estate sectors are closely intertwined, with several funds targeting healthcare-related real estate projects, reflecting the ongoing need for specialized facilities like hospitals and senior living centers. Geographic distribution: From a geographic perspective, North America continues to lead, particularly within the energy and private equity sectors. However, the global focus of several funds reflects an increasing desire for international diversification. Global strategies remain prevalent, with investors keen to capitalize on opportunities across both developed and emerging markets. Firms like Capital Dynamics and Stone Point Capital maintain a global investment outlook, with exposure to multiple regions such as North America, Europe, and beyond. This global perspective allows investors to balance regional risks and access growth markets outside the traditional confines of North American investments. Start leveraging these trends! This week’s new fund filings reflect the ongoing strength of private equity across various strategies, from co-investments to fund of funds. Sectors such as energy, financial services, and healthcare are seeing robust activity, as they present both resilience and growth potential in an evolving economic landscape. Venture capital remains an active space, with continued focus on early-stage, high-growth sectors. Geographically, the funds are maintaining a global approach, ensuring diverse exposure across multiple regions while maintaining a core focus on North America. As the market continues to adapt to economic and industry shifts, these trends suggest that investors are positioning themselves for both short-term resilience and long-term growth across a range of asset classes and industries.

{'title': 'Creating a Repeatable, Successful Sales Process: Principle 4 - Have a Killer Follow-Up System', 'introduction': "In the dynamic world of sales, success hinges on more than just ambition and persistence; it requires creating a repeatable sales process. We understand the intricacies of this challenging field - marked by emotional ups and downs, extended sales cycles, and frequent rejections. At Dakota, we’ve created this repeatable process for our investment sales team. Our four core principles have led us to success, and provided 20 years of results. We review these principles monthly in our Rainmaker sessions with Gui Costin. This is a class for any investment sales professional as it lays out the blueprint for a winning sales strategy. No matter the experience level - wanting to touch up, wanting to learn tips and tricks, or new to fundraising - Rainmaker is a sales training program with proven results. In this article we are diving into principle four to creating a repeatable sales process: having a killer follow-up system. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of how to leverage your CRM to 10x productivity, as well as taking actionable steps to help reach your fundraising goals. To learn more about our four principles to sales, check out an upcoming Rainmaker Live! session with Gui Costin. Principle 4: have a killer follow-up system In the world of investment management and sales, your ability to follow up effectively can be a game-changer. Building a robust follow-up system ensures that you're not only efficient but also that you don't miss out on valuable opportunities. In this article, we will delve into the importance of maintaining detailed meeting notes, activity reports, and well-managed pipeline reports to boost your success in the industry. A CRM system can be a salesperson's best friend. Despite complaints about their complexity and data quality, a well-used CRM can significantly enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The key is to ensure that all past meetings are entered into the CRM. The details of each meeting become valuable pieces of information that can trigger future actions and help you stay on top of your follow-up game. Let’s get into three ways to leverage your CRM. 1. Logging meetings notes After your meeting concludes, the critical next step is logging the details into your CRM system. While it may seem like a tedious task, it is indispensable for ensuring effective follow-up. By entering your meeting notes into the CRM, you pave the way for a streamlined follow-up process. This practice leverages your CRM’s capabilities to significantly enhance your efficiency, allowing for follow-ups with just one click. Not only does this approach 10x your productivity, but it also keeps you exceptionally organized. With all relevant information stored and easily accessible within your CRM, you can quickly initiate follow-up communications, ensuring no opportunities are missed. This systematic tracking of interactions via your CRM is key to maintaining ongoing engagement and driving business success. 2. Build activity reports and pipeline reports Creating past activity reports in your CRM is akin to accumulating bars of gold. Every meeting you've had represents a bar of gold that can be leveraged in the future. These reports are essential for reviewing your sales activities and ensuring that you're sticking to your sales plan. They enable you to track your progress, manage your expectations, and stay on top of your follow-up responsibilities. Pipeline reports are your guiding compass through the sales journey. They keep you on course and help you navigate the opportunities ahead. With a structured pipeline report, you can clearly see the status of each opportunity, the expected close date, the client's contact details, and the current status and next steps. These reports not only help you manage your leads efficiently but also serve as reminders to take action, ensuring no opportunity falls through the cracks. 3. Power of structured check-ins Regular check-ins are game-changers when it comes to maintaining effective follow-up. These check-ins are a means to tap into the collective knowledge of your team. The process of sharing insights, client conversations, and good news helps ensure that everyone is on the same page. They also enable you to build a strong support system within your team, ultimately leading to more productive follow-up activities. Putting into practice In the highly competitive world of investment management and sales, a robust follow-up system is essential. Building this system requires maintaining detailed meeting notes, generating past activity reports, and effectively managing pipeline reports. These tools, when used correctly, will not only enhance your efficiency but also improve your effectiveness, ultimately leading to greater success in your endeavors. In conclusion, the fourth principle of the Rainmaker sales training emphasizes the effective use of a CRM system. Sales professionals can not only streamline their follow-up activities but also enhance overall productivity by a significant margin. Logging detailed meeting notes, creating comprehensive activity and pipeline reports, and conducting regular structured check-ins are not just administrative tasks - they are strategic steps that form the backbone of a successful sales strategy. This principle, along with the three others taught in the Rainmaker sessions, provides a clear and effective blueprint for any investment sales professional looking to excel in this dynamic industry. By embracing these practices, sales teams can ensure they never miss an opportunity and always stay ahead in the competitive world of investment sales.

# article_315_how-to-sync-your-outlook-calendar-with-salesforce

{'title': 'How to Sync Your Outlook Calendar With Salesforce', 'introduction': "As an investment salesperson, adding meetings to your calendar, Zoom, Salesforce, and other platforms can be tedious. Even though you know that it's also necessary so that you can follow-up effectively, it does make you feel more like a data entry person than a salesperson, especially if you're setting up a lot of meetings per day. To eliminate the double entry of meetings, Salesforce allows its users to sync their Outlook Calendars with their Salesforce instance. This takes away some of the friction when it comes to entering meetings, and ensures that you’re not missing any crucial meetings on either platform. At Dakota, entering meetings and meeting notes in Salesforce is something that is part of our sales team’s DNA, and we believe it’s critical to enter accurate, reliable meeting information in order to do follow-up effectively. We’ve been using Salesforce as our CRM to do just this since 2006, and have raised over $40 billion in that time. In this article, we’re sharing how you can sync your Outlook calendar with Salesforce to increase your team’s efficiency and create a follow-up system. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear idea of how to get started. First, we’ll dive into why syncing between your calendar and Salesforce matters. The cost of meeting double-entry We all know that there are so many hours in the day, and if you’re having your sales team spend their time entering meetings and meeting details across multiple platforms, chances are, they’re missing out on doing much more productive activities. small free trial banner Syncing meetings across platforms allows for three key things: Salespeople can stay focused on selling. Did you know that salespeople spend over half of their day doing activities that aren’t selling? Things like data and meeting entry are some of the tasks that take them away from what they should be doing, which is setting and holding meetings. Eliminate errors and bad data. Having people enter meetings again and again only increases the likelihood of a date being entered incorrectly, a name getting spelled wrong, or someone being left off the invitation list. Syncing meetings removes the human error factor and ensures nothing gets missed. Increased CRM adoption. We’ve said it time and again, but the number one reason your sales team doesn’t want to use their CRM is because the data inside of it is bad, outdated, or incomplete. If they know that good, accurate data is getting put into the CRM (and even better — getting put in automatically), they’re far more likely to fully adopt the CRM in the end. Next we’ll outline the three simple steps to setting up the sync between your Outlook Calendar and Salesforce. How to sync your Outlook Calendar with Salesforce The sync between your inbox and your Salesforce instance can be done using Salesforce’s Einstein Activity Capture feature. Einstein Activity Capture allows both admins and users to enable a sync between both Google and Outlook Calendars and Salesforce in just three steps. From your personal settings, enter Connected Accounts in the Quick Find box, and then select Email and Calendar Accounts. If your admin connected an account for you, it will be listed under Connected Accounts. If it’s not, try refreshing the page. Click New Account. Follow the steps to connect your account. After you connect an account, it takes up to 24 hours for Einstein Activity Capture to add your emails and events to related Salesforce records, but Inbox features are available right away.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'How to Sync Your Outlook Calendar With Salesforce', 'content': "As an investment salesperson, adding meetings to your calendar, Zoom, Salesforce, and other platforms can be tedious.

At Dakota, entering meetings and meeting notes in Salesforce is something that is part of our sales team’s DNA, and we believe it’s critical to enter accurate, reliable meeting information in order to do follow-up effectively. We’ve been using Salesforce as our CRM to do just this since 2006, and have raised over $40 billion in that time. In this article, we’re sharing how you can sync your Outlook calendar with Salesforce to increase your team’s efficiency and create a follow-up system. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear idea of how to get started. First, we’ll dive into why syncing between your calendar and Salesforce matters. The cost of meeting double-entry We all know that there are so many hours in the day, and if you’re having your sales team spend their time entering meetings and meeting details across multiple platforms, chances are, they’re missing out on doing much more productive activities. small free trial banner Syncing meetings across platforms allows for three key things: Salespeople can stay focused on selling. Did you know that salespeople spend over half of their day doing activities that aren’t selling? Things like data and meeting entry are some of the tasks that take them away from what they should be doing, which is setting and holding meetings. Eliminate errors and bad data. Having people enter meetings again and again only increases the likelihood of a date being entered incorrectly, a name getting spelled wrong, or someone being left off the invitation list. Syncing meetings removes the human error factor and ensures nothing gets missed. Increased CRM adoption. We’ve said it time and again, but the number one reason your sales team doesn’t want to use their CRM is because the data inside of it is bad, outdated, or incomplete. If they know that good, accurate data is getting put into the CRM (and even better — getting put in automatically), they’re far more likely to fully adopt the CRM in the end. Next we’ll outline the three simple steps to setting up the sync between your Outlook Calendar and Salesforce. How to sync your Outlook Calendar with Salesforce The sync between your inbox and your Salesforce instance can be done using Salesforce’s Einstein Activity Capture feature. Einstein Activity Capture allows both admins and users to enable a sync between both Google and Outlook Calendars and Salesforce in just three steps. From your personal settings, enter Connected Accounts in the Quick Find box, and then select Email and Calendar Accounts. If your admin connected an account for you, it will be listed under Connected Accounts. If it’s not, try refreshing the page. Click New Account. Follow the steps to connect your account. After you connect an account, it takes up to 24 hours for Einstein Activity Capture to add your emails and events to related Salesforce records, but Inbox features are available right away.", 'bullet_points': [], 'subsections': []}], 'key_takeaways': [], 'faqs': []}

# article_369_7-things-every-investment-sales-person-should-do-b

{'title': '7 Things Every Investment Sales Person Should Do Before a Meeting', 'introduction': "Setting up meetings is the first step in the process to raising money. After all, no sale can happen without that meeting. As an investment sales person, you already know that getting a meeting can feel like the hardest part of your day to day. And more than that, every meeting you set will run a little differently based on who you’re talking to. But, that doesn’t mean you can’t prepare things in advance to ensure that every meeting goes as smoothly as possible. Here at Dakota, we’ve had great success setting up meetings and coming out with a win. Our team is a third party marketer who has been setting meetings and has raised over $35B since 2006. Even though each meeting may be different, we’ve identified a few things you should do before every one. We are here to share our tips and tricks. We’ll break this article into two sections: one that guides you through the four steps to take to prepare for a meeting, and one that guides you through the next three steps that come when confirming your meeting. By the end of this article, you’ll have a clear vision on the items you need to check off your list in order to successfully set yourself up for a meeting. How to prepare for an investment sales meeting 1. Know who you’re meeting with To start off, you will want to know who you are meeting with. This may seem obvious, but it makes a world of difference. This can be as simple as going to the firm’s website and looking at a picture of them, conducting background research on their role, or reading their bio. By doing so, you may be able to form a connection — this can make the conversation feel more natural and personal, and not so much like a meeting you’re checking off your to-do list. 2. Review their website for their current thinking There is a high probability the firm has articles published, video content uploaded, or white papers available on their website. This content presents how they are thinking about asset allocation, and gives great insight into their approach and how you might work together. Knowing more on the front end empowers you to make the meeting more relevant for them. 3.  Prepare all meeting attendees in advance of the meeting If you are bringing a portfolio manager, they should feel primed and prepped for the meeting. Make sure they have any questions, marketing materials, and background information in advance. If you will be referencing something during the meeting, it’s important that they have it ahead of time so that they can prepare effectively. This will also allow them to ask any relevant questions and sound prepared as the meeting starts. 4. Prepare the meeting agenda The final preparation component we’ll touch on is preparing the agenda for the meeting. Keep in mind that not every meeting needs one. For example, a short, introductory meeting would not require an agenda. However, for a due diligence meeting where you are coordinating multiple people, or if there are specific things you want to cover, an agenda can be very useful to have and send ahead of time for your team to review and prepare. How to effectively confirm your meeting 5. Confirm the meeting using a statement rather than a question Confirmation is a key factor for investment sales people. Something to keep in mind is to confirm the meeting as a statement. By posing the confirmation as a question, “Does Thursday at 10 AM still work for you?” attendees are more likely to cancel or reschedule. On the other hand, saying, “I look forward to seeing you on Thursday at 10 AM” leaves less room for the person to cancel. 6. Confirm the address and office location This cannot be stressed enough, as it would be embarrassing to show up at the wrong place, city, or even someone’s home instead of the local coffee joint. 7. Send a calendar invitation This is another factor that is so simple, yet often overlooked and taken for granted. Be sure to include the correct time and location, as well as sending this to the correct invitee. The invitation will serve as a confirmation for the meeting in addition to being a helpful reminder for not only your team but your attendees as well. Crushing your next investment sales meeting Whether you are running your first meeting or about to host your hundredth, it comes down to properly preparing and confirming. Although these tasks seem simple, they are often overlooked and can be forgotten about. Start by doing your research so that you’re setting the meeting with the right people, confirm it, and set the meeting. You'll find that the meetings are more organized, more productive, and lead to stronger relationships in the long run.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': '7 Things Every Investment Sales Person Should Do Before a Meeting', 'content': "Setting up meetings is the first step in the process to raising money.

# article_376_investment-data-solutions-which-is-right-for-your

{'title': 'Investment Data Solutions: Which is Right For Your Firm?', 'introduction': "If you’re in the investment industry, you know how hard it can be to trust a database that promises to do it all: provide clean data, ensure you have new leads, and update the accounts and contact within it effectively. How can you be sure they mean what they say? After all, we’ve all been on the receiving end of mass emails offering “databases” that will solve all of our problems. Have those databases ever delivered on that promise? We’re willing to bet they haven't. The truth is we’d argue that most of them aren’t valuable. But that doesn’t mean every data solution is unreliable. As a data solution provider ourselves, we’ve talked about the benefits of an all-in-one data solution before, along with how much we believe they can help your sales team increase their leads and set up more meetings than ever. To be clear, we’re not saying that our database is the only answer and we’re not here to talk about ourselves. In fact this article will share some of the best investment-specific data solutions (ours not included), how they work, which platforms they’re compatible with, and how often they are updated, so that you can decide for yourself which is right for your team. By the end of this article, you’ll have a complete overview of your options, and will be able to move forward with a platform that meets your needs, and empowers your sales team. Discovery Data Marketlink API How it works The Discovery Data Marketlink API connects your CRM with their database through an API, allowing you to receive regular updates from their database. Update frequency You can receive updates in real-time, meaning that as soon as their data is updated, you can receive appended data directly to your CRM through the API. CRM compatibility The Marketlink API promises seamless CRM integration, which implies that it has the ability to work with any CRM, Salesforce among others. Customization capability The API can be fully customized to match your CRM account and contact fields. Who is Discovery Data Marketlink API right for? This option would be a fit for firms with large datasets that require daily, active updates. Because you can run the API as often as needed, you can ensure that your data is as accurate as possible. Money Market Directory Data Xpressfeed How it works Money Market Directory offers several data management options, including the Xpressfeed API, which connects their data platform to your data management systems. This can be done through your CRM, proprietary analytics, or your financial portals, with the goal of enhancing data before it is used. Update frequency Like Discovery Data’s option above, the Xpressfeed API can be run at any time, allowing your team to have control over what data comes over into your system and when. CRM compatibility While Xpressfeed is not a CRM-specific solution, it is compatible with a variety of systems, including CRMs, meaning you can integrate it with the existing data in your CRM for updates as needed. Customization capability Xpressfeed Data is delivered in packages, via the Xpressfeed Loader, so you can customize and receive only what you want and need, or, receive all of the data at once. Who is Xpressfeed right for? This solution would be a good fit for anyone with a wide expanse of data on a variety of platforms. Because it can connect to several data management tools, it would allow all your data to be updated as needed, rather than just your CRM data. MARS Salesfocus Solutions How it works The MARS CRM Solution supports the retail and institutional sides of the investment business and includes asset management industry-specific features such as comprehensive channel/territory management, profiling, document management, and overlays MARS CRM and sales data with Google Maps to provide data as well as actionable business insights. Update frequency The MARS CRM Solution provides real-time updates to your data, meaning it can be refreshed as often as needed. CRM compatibility The Mars solution is specific to Salesforce and Microsoft Dynamic CRMs. Customization capability This option can be customized to include data feeds from outside sources including ETF and DCIO providers, Market Intelligence and RIA Data Providers. Who is MARS Salesfocus Solution right for? This platform is a fit for anyone using Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics specifically. It would also be a good fit for firms looking to incorporate data from several data platforms at once. How to decide which data solution is right for you While it depends on the individual needs and budget of your firm, we think that having an all-in-one data solution can be extremely beneficial. Now that you’ve seen some of the best options available, we’ll dive into which solution might be the best fit for you. If your team is working with a large dataset that needs constant attention and updating, then Discovery Data’s Marketlink API might be the best fit, since it offers real-time, daily updates to the data. However, if your dataset is large and spread out across a variety of platforms, then Money Market Directory’s Xpressfeed might be the best choice for you, since this solution allows you to receive data not only to your CRM, but a variety of other platforms as well. Finally, if you’re using Salesforce or Microsoft Dynamics, and want to incorporate many datasource into the data you receive, MARS Salesfocus Solutions would be a fit for your team. If you’re still unsure which solution is right for you, we’d like to tell you about our own solution, the Dakota Marketplace for Salesforce App, which is an all-in-one data solution that connects our own Marketplace data with your Salesforce to ensure that your data is updated in real-time. In addition to these updates, you’ll receive notifications when someone in your database changes roles or firms, so that you’re never left to chase down leads, or wonder if your emails are getting through to the right people.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'Investment Data Solutions: Which is Right For Your Firm?', 'content': "If you’re in the investment industry, you know how hard it can be to trust a database that promises to do it all: provide clean data, ensure you have new leads, and update the accounts and contact within it effectively.

# article_381_how-to-host-a-quarterly-webinar-for-asset-managers

{'title': 'How to Host a Quarterly Webinar for Asset Managers', 'introduction': 'If you’re an asset manager, you already know how quickly January turns to March, signaling the end of another quarter, and with it, the need to report on your quarterly performance. If you find yourself scrambling at the end of every quarter, or are just searching for a more organized and streamlined way to share this information, a quarterly webinar may be the answer you’re looking for. Since the start of a new year is the best time to establish new habits, we wanted to share some guidelines in advance of quarter end, to successfully  plan for and host these webinars, ultimately giving you enough time to prepare. At Dakota, we host a webinar with each of our investment managers at the end of every quarter, and have established some clear best practices that we think will help you plan and schedule your own quarterly webinars going forward. In this article, we’ll break down the benefits of hosting a webinar, what you should include in each one, as well as some tips and tricks to help you be as polished as possible. By the end of this article, you’ll have a clear path forward to more regular, transparent performance communication with your clients. Why your firm should host a quarterly webinar There are a number of reasons we recommend these events, but the biggest reason is that it encourages consistent, transparent communications, something that is especially important in a world where we are not meeting in person. They build consistency. A quarterly webinar helps to create a high level of transparency, and helps build a sense of familiarity with your existing clients and prospects alike. Because they establish transparency surrounding performance and outlook, these webinars can be a great fundraising opportunity. They allow you to grow your existing  relationships as you build more confidence in your team and your strategy, which helps to keep your firm top of mind for future allocations to your asset class. They’re a great marketing opportunity. By sending quarterly invitations, you’re creating a reliable touchpoint with clients and prospects. Additionally, these webinars are a great place to promote your firm and strategy in an organized manner. However, this marketing is not just in the invitation itself, but in the replay offered afterwards, but about the ability to use the replay as a way to follow up with a recording, transcript, and summary of everything discussed on the webinar. This also allows you to create a library of informational content for due diligence analysts to access when they are interested in your strategy. They create scale and efficiency: This gives you the opportunity to get your portfolio managers on a webinar through a conference call or over Zoom. You’ll  have the chance to leverage time effectively by giving your portfolio managers a platform  to speak to a large number of people who want to hear  an update for the quarter. In addition to the webinar, you can also reach out for one on one conversations with clients. More often than not, these clients have already listened to the webinar, either live or through a replay. These one-on-one calls can provide clients the opportunity to ask more specific questions that may not have been addressed on the broader webinar.  You are able to hold these  follow up calls  in twenty to thirty minutes rather than spending a full hour with every client, maximizing  time on both ends. By having a high-touch client services approach, you’re saving portfolio managers time. How to structure the webinar There should be a set structure and plan to each of your webinars, so that over time, your audience comes to expect each piece. We have seen success doing the following, and would recommend you touch on each component. . While the specific needs of each firm will vary, this outline should give you an idea of how to plan out your own event. Script this part out so that it stays within the time frame, and presents a polished overview of your firm and strategy. Key components of the webinar: A firm update: This section should cover any changes in key personnel, ownership structure, updates  in AUM, and anything else you want to highlight as it relates to the firm as a whole. A reminder of the firm’s philosophy and process: This is a good opportunity to remind the audience who you are and what you’re attempting to achieve with your strategy. Quarterly results: Cover what happened over the last quarter; this can be both performance and attribution. Explain what occurred over the period that you’re covering, pointing out key performance drivers, as well as providing  context on an absolute and relative basis. Positioning: Explain any changes that were made to the portfolio over the last quarter: adds or trims, and anything that may have impacted sector allocations. Cover how the strategy is currently positioned, as well as any new stocks to the portfolio, that are significant relative to the last time you reported. This is a great opportunity to highlight  those changes, and give the rationale behind the change. Closing remarks: This can be an outlook on how you believe the next quarter will perform, or comments on the macro environment. However, any macro comments you make should always tie back to your portfolio — How are you positioned in terms of the industry overall? Giving an outlook on a more broad scale is always welcome, but it is more helpful to position it in a way that gives people an idea of what to expect from you in the coming months. This lets the audience know how the portfolio is currently positioned, as well as how it should hold up or react in the current or future environment. Q&A: Opening up the meeting for dialogue and questions helps get the audience engaged. If you are working with a more quiet group, or you’re unsure what your turnout will be, especially early on, we recommend preparing some questions to go over at the end to facilitate that conversation. Other tips and tricks for hosting a quarterly webinar Be consistent. Hold these webinars in good times and bad times, as this will help build trust that you are reliable no matter the environment. This is especially important in times of volatility, when your clients and partners will want to know that you’re there and where you stand. In short: being just as visible when you’re out of favor as when you’re in favor is critical, and these webinars are a great way to do that on a consistent basis. Establish a clear communication cadence. Plan each quarterly webinar out in advance. We recommend scheduling them as far out as you can, so that there is enough time for your team to prepare, and for your audience to schedule time to attend. This includes sending emails up to two weeks before, and two weeks after, establishing a level of clear communication and setting expectations. Be prepared. We know this may seem simple, but having your remarks prepared ahead of time helps keep things as organized and polished as possible. It not only builds credibility with your audience, but it can also save you time with compliance down the line, by having your comments and scripts reviewed beforehand. How to get started First, set a date. Once you have that established, you will be able to outline a clear timeline, create a presentation, and start communicating with your clients and prospects. Our biggest piece of advice? Just get started. We know there are a million reasons to postpone it, but creating a habit and setting expectations now, both internally and externally, will help you become a clear leader in the industry. And more than that, it will ensure that your firm is top of mind when new allocations become available.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'How to Host a Quarterly Webinar for Asset Managers', 'content': 'If you’re an asset manager, you already know how quickly January turns to March, signaling the end of another quarter, and with it, the need to report on your quarterly performance.

# article_393_how-to-build-community-through-world-class-virtual

{'title': 'How to Build Community Through World Class Virtual Events in 2021', 'introduction': "What does an 85,000 word work of Harry Potter fanfiction, a man obsessed with The Grateful Dead, and the investment industry have in common? On the surface? Nothing. In practice? They all have the ability to bring people together with words, stories, and a sense of community. We know what you’re probably thinking. And, if you’re in an industry as highly regulated as the financial and investment space, you aren’t wrong. You already know how difficult it can be to follow traditional marketing and outreach advice in an industry like this one. Given the layers of compliance we have to go through, it can feel like there is little room for creativity or personality in the marketing we are able to do. That doesn’t have to be the case. In his books, Fanocracy, Standout Virtual Events, as well as in a recent speaking event, Wall Street Journal bestselling author, David Meerman Scott provided us with some insight on how to create fans in the most unlikely places, and how to host virtual events that connect with an audience — no matter where they are. With COVID forcing everyone to pivot from in-person to virtual events, most of us are still figuring out how to do that in a way that connects with our audience. In this post, we’re sharing some of David Meerman Scott’s top tips for creating fans and hosting truly memorable virtual events. By the end of this article, you’ll have the know-how and confidence needed to transform your events and quarterly webinars into world class events that keeps your viewers engaged. 1. Build a community through video Did you know? Humans are hardwired to be part of a tribe of like-minded people. Many businesses get tripped up by the idea that they are the outlier to this. That they are the only ones not conducive to building a community, to building fans, but that is not the case. As David Meerman Scott explains, every business is conducive to building a fanbase and a community. It starts with the neuroscience behind video. Think about an actor or actress you love, and how it sometimes feels like you know them after your binge watching a TV show or series of movies. This is because when you watch someone up close for so long, it gives the illusion that you know them. Of course you don't actually know your favorite celebrities, but it can certainly feel that way. This is because when you’re close to someone, within their “social space,” the closer you feel to them. When you can’t engage with people at this distance physically, it becomes critically important to replicate that feeling through video. The same can be true for you once you make the switch to video. By making subtle changes, like setting yourself up four feet from your camera, and not letting slides dominate your presentation or webinar, is the first step. You can do this by making quick changes like adding a monitor, and investing in a DJ stand for your laptop. Simple things like this can make a world of difference to your audience, because especially in a time when we are all physically distanced, it allows us to feel like we’re close. 2. Get your audience engaged — and keep them engaged The key here is not to talk at your audience, no matter what kind of virtual event you’re hosting. Instead, drive engagement, make the audience feel like they’re part of something, rather than sitting through yet another slide deck presentation at the end of the quarter. There are a few ways this can be done. Use the chat box. This is a simple change that few people think about. Using the chat window that Zoom provides is a quick and easy way to get the audience thinking and involved in the presentation. Get them warmed up and talking, while keeping them engaged with what you’re saying. Take polls. Another feature that comes preinstalled with Zoom, polls are a quick way to keep your finger on the pulse of your audience. Ask about things specific to their industry, yes or no questions, etc. This not only helps you get a better understanding of your audience, but again helps them feel more engaged with you. Use breakout rooms. By getting people broken out into smaller groups, it makes any presentation feel more personal and connected. Keep segments short. Keeping the energy up in an in-person presentation or talk is easy, because we’re used to it. But how do you keep people engaged throughout an hour-long webinar? Keep the sections short and sweet, breaking them up with polls and chats like we mentioned above. This makes any event feel like it’s moving along at a fast clip, so no one starts to feel restless. 3. Be human So often, our quest to be professional, to be thought leaders in our industry, removes the thing that drives us every day: passion. Webinars, websites, and LinkedIn are full of industry jargon and buzzwords; so much so that everything starts to feel like background noise. How do you cut through and make an impact when everyone is saying the same thing? Be yourself. This sounds like such a simple concept, but think about the last time you said something about yourself on LinkedIn, or any of your business accounts. It’s probably few and far between, if it’s ever been done before. Something like this can elevate not only your virtual events, but your entire brand persona. People are further from each other than ever before, they want genuine connection, not another buzzword. Another way to make your audience feel more connected with you and feel more human is to get rid of those stock photos. You know the ones. They’re all over websites in every industry, and they put you and your audience at a distance. David Meerman Scott recommends replacing them with photos of your actual business, the real people who work every day behind the scenes, to give people an idea of who you really are. How to get started There are a lot of small changes that can be added to your existing video set up to help take it to the next level, like that dj stand we mentioned earlier. Another is a professional grade microphone, and a nice backdrop. Once you’ve done that, there are several tips from David Meerman Scott recommends: Go-Pro Hero 8 A ring light No virtual backgrounds — replace them with a screen if needed Yeti Microphone DJ stand However, before you change any of those things, you have to start with letting go of the idea that building a community is not for you or your business. Once you’ve done that, it’s time to get to work.

On the surface? Nothing. In practice? They all have the ability to bring people together with words, stories, and a sense of community. We know what you’re probably thinking. And, if you’re in an industry as highly regulated as the financial and investment space, you aren’t wrong. You already know how difficult it can be to follow traditional marketing and outreach advice in an industry like this one. Given the layers of compliance we have to go through, it can feel like there is little room for creativity or personality in the marketing we are able to do. That doesn’t have to be the case. In his books, Fanocracy, Standout Virtual Events, as well as in a recent speaking event, Wall Street Journal bestselling author, David Meerman Scott provided us with some insight on how to create fans in the most unlikely places, and how to host virtual events that connect with an audience — no matter where they are. With COVID forcing everyone to pivot from in-person to virtual events, most of us are still figuring out how to do that in a way that connects with our audience. In this post, we’re sharing some of David Meerman Scott’s top tips for creating fans and hosting truly memorable virtual events. By the end of this article, you’ll have the know-how and confidence needed to transform your events and quarterly webinars into world class events that keeps your viewers engaged. 1. Build a community through video Did you know? Humans are hardwired to be part of a tribe of like-minded people. Many businesses get tripped up by the idea that they are the outlier to this. That they are the only ones not conducive to building a community, to building fans, but that is not the case. As David Meerman Scott explains, every business is conducive to building a fanbase and a community. It starts with the neuroscience behind video. Think about an actor or actress you love, and how it sometimes feels like you know them after your binge watching a TV show or series of movies. This is because when you watch someone up close for so long, it gives the illusion that you know them. Of course you don't actually know your favorite celebrities, but it can certainly feel that way. This is because when you’re close to someone, within their “social space,” the closer you feel to them. When you can’t engage with people at this distance physically, it becomes critically important to replicate that feeling through video. The same can be true for you once you make the switch to video.

# article_057_build-your-presence-5-reasons-why-investment-indus

{'title': 'Build Your Presence: 5 Reasons Why Investment Industry Conferences Are Key to Relationship Building', 'introduction': 'In the investment world, putting yourself out there can feel intimidating. The fear of rejection is something we all face. But the reality is, success often comes from taking that leap and ensuring people know your name. Attending industry conferences presents the perfect opportunity to overcome those fears, build valuable connections, and solidify your presence. At Dakota, we’ve spent 20 years confronting the fear of rejection, and we can tell you – it’s worth it. Consistently putting your name out there in front of industry professionals is crucial for growth. However, it’s not just about attending; it’s about maximizing your time. As you plan where to invest your time and resources, it’s equally important to know how to get the most out of every conference. The goal is to return with a clear list of contacts, next steps, and actionable goals. In this article, we’ll explore five reasons why attending conferences is essential for building relationships. By the end, you’ll have a clearer understanding of how to leverage your efforts before, during, and after each event. 1. Get Your Name in Front of Decision-Makers At investment industry conferences, you’ll be face-to-face with allocators, fund managers, and institutional investors. These are the people who have the power to decide on the next big opportunity. Personal interactions, even short conversations, increase your chances of being remembered when they’re considering partnerships or fundraising decisions. Your presence solidifies your credibility and makes sure your name is top-of-mind in the right circles. 2. Build New, Strategic Relationships Every conference is a marketplace for new connections. Whether you’re at a networking session or in between panels, these events give you direct access to potential investors and partners. Planning ahead, such as scheduling meetings before the conference starts, helps maximize your time. The relationships you forge here could open doors to future deals or collaborations that would otherwise take months to develop. New call-to-action 3. Strengthen Existing Connections The investment industry is relationship-driven, and conferences provide an excellent venue to reconnect with current clients, partners, and colleagues. Strengthening these bonds is as important as building new ones. By regularly meeting face-to-face at conferences, you demonstrate your commitment to the relationship and ensure you stay on their radar for future deals or partnerships. 4. Stay Updated on Market Trends Staying ahead of the curve is crucial in the investment world, where trends shift quickly. Conferences offer valuable content sessions led by industry leaders on emerging market opportunities, regulatory changes, and fundraising strategies. These insights can inform your approach, allowing you to adjust your strategy based on what’s coming next in the marketplace. 5. Post-Conference Follow-Up The most important part of the conference often happens after it ends. Timely and strategic follow-up is essential for maintaining momentum with new contacts and opportunities. Enter your connections into your CRM system and reach out with personalized follow-ups to solidify the relationships you started at the event. This is where the real potential lies - turning introductions into long-term partnerships or investments. Leverage Conferences for Your Relationship-Building Investment industry conferences are not just opportunities to learn; they are essential for building your personal brand, strengthening existing relationships, and putting your name in front of key decision-makers. Whether you’re focused on fundraising or expanding your network, attending conferences will keep you connected and relevant in an ever-changing marketplace.

# article_341_3-ways-to-establish-a-growth-mindset-across-your-i

{'title': '3 Ways to Establish a Growth Mindset Across Your Investment Sales Team', 'introduction': 'If you’re in the investment sales industry, then you already know that getting a meeting, building a relationship, and getting a deal closed is no easy feat. In fact, you probably know without being told that sales is a very, very difficult job. Why? Because it deals with human emotion and rejection: things that are completely outside of your control. You can\'t control the person who you\'re calling on, right? If you send someone an email asking for a meeting and they don\'t respond, that’s out of your control. On any given day, you probably have 50 different things in your brain aside from just that one unanswered email, which means that your mindset is critical. Often in sales — and, really, any profession — when you’re scared of something, it becomes emotional, and chances are you’re going to try to avoid doing that thing. You\'re going to avoid that place of pain, even if it hinders you in the long run. If you’re scared of getting ignored, you\'re going to avoid sending an email for fear of rejection, which means you don\'t take any action because you\'re scared of getting rejected. However, to be an effective salesperson, you have to be asking for something all the time. You have to be asking for a face-to-face meeting, an introductory meeting, or asking for next steps. At Dakota, we call it the A-word. You have to be asking for something all the time, and then you need to track your asks. Continually asking, tracking, and snapping out of that place of fear is what will drive results for your sales team. But in order to get there, everyone on your team needs to embrace a growth mindset. In this article, we\'re outlining the two keys to a growth mindset: focus and structure. By the end of this article, you’ll have a clear understanding of the importance of growth mindset, and the two things to optimize that will lead to success for you and your sales team. 1. Focus on what matters most Mindset is important, but it\'s almost important to realize that you are only human. Having that concern about being rejected or somebody not returning your phone call is normal. Consider this: it might just be that they\'re busy or it might be the time that they\'re not interested in your strategy. You can\'t take it personally. This is where your mindset becomes so important. At Dakota, we call this focusing on what you can control. This is the key to having a growth mindset. If you\'re focusing on things that are out of your control, getting angry when there\'s an obstacle, making excuses or assigning blame, chances are you aren\'t doing the things that matter most, and you’re wasting your time. The second key to a growth mindset mindset is focusing on what matters most. Ultimately, the only thing that matters in sales is if you\'re asking for meetings with your qualified buyers. You have to train your mind to think that way. You can do other things, but don\'t sit there and lie to yourself and say, "Oh no, I really have to clean up my desk," or "I really have to tackle this to-do list before I reach out," or even, "I have to write this other long email." The reality is, you\'re making up reasons to avoid what matters most. You don\'t really need to do any of those things. Instead, you need to be spending your time either doing meetings with qualified buyers, finding new qualified buyers to call on, or calling on them to try to get a face to face meeting. Then, of course, begins your follow-up. As we’ve stated prior, mindset is focusing on what matters most. In this case, what matters most is calling on qualified buyers. You must believe at the end of the day, in your heart of hearts, that every day is a great day to sell. 2. Add structure We\'re not here to tell you that it\'s easy, but the more focus and structure that you have within your organization will make everything simpler. If you don\'t have focus as a salesperson, you can get really lost. Let’s use city scheduling for this example. You walk into your office knowing that you\'ve picked five cities to go visit, and in each city you’ve outlined times; your day now has focus and structure. Now that you have dates and times, your job is to go into the database, look at all the qualified buyers, and try to plug the holes — where are there times throughout your trip that you can fill with meetings? Find those gaps and continue to do outreach and schedule more meetings. From a mindset perspective, you want to make sure that you\'re setting yourself up for success to win — avoid coming in every day and winging it. The mindset of a great salesperson is to focus on what matters most, and then add structure. At Dakota, we believe that this structure all comes down to city scheduling, which allows you to have focus to set up meetings with your qualified buyers. The growth mindset is that every day is a great day to sell, focus on what matters most, and then adding structure. At the end of the day, you will slide into your structure. It gives you purpose. It gives you focus to do what\'s most important and what matters most. 3. Use technology to track your team\'s growth Now that you\'ve conquered your fears, started setting meetings, and added structure with city scheduling, it\'s time to use technology to bring it all together and track your progress. First, you\'ll need to get all the meetings that you schedule into your CRM. At Dakota this happens to be Salesforce. Salesforce allows you to track where you\'ve been; as soon as you enter one meeting that you scheduled, it can now go into a report because you\'ve set up other reports of your past 14 days of meetings, you pass 30, and you pass 90. The reports are dynamically updated as you update the database, and you\'re able to go in and do your follow-up without even having to think. This is the whole job of success in sales, unless you\'re calling on one or two accounts, and it\'s a huge elephant hunter for most of us — don\'t do that. We must call on a lot of firms, and set a lot of meetings. You want to make it effortless and mindless to know who you should be following up with after you\'ve met with them. This will also allow you to cover more ground. If all your information is in yellow pads and the back of business cards, you\'re only going to be more disorganized. You can\'t sit down and hammer through a list that\'s sitting right in front of you. Leverage all the available tools to make yourself more efficient, which allows you to end up becoming more effective. Bring it all together for sales success We can\'t promise that establishing a growth mindset across your sales team is going to be easy — but we can promise that it will be worth it. Once there is complete buy-in, and you start working as a team to establish the building blocks outlined above, you\'re going to see an increase in meetings as well as efficiency. To get started means committing to focus. Pick one thing per day that scares you and do it. Whether it\'s asking for a meeting, following up on what you thought was a cold lead, or something else entirely. The more you do this, the more natural it\'ll become. Next, you\'ll want to add structure to those behaviors, and start tracking them with something like Salesforce so that you can effectively follow-up. This leads to more growth, more closed deals, and more efficiency all around.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': '3 Ways to Establish a Growth Mindset Across Your Investment Sales Team', 'content': 'If you’re in the investment sales industry, then you already know that getting a meeting, building a relationship, and getting a deal closed is no easy feat.

# article_278_investment-industry-conferences-8-tips-to-maximize

{'title': 'Investment Industry Conferences: 8 Tips to Maximize Your Experience', 'introduction': 'If you’re looking ahead to next year — or even the next few months — and starting to plan your conference and travel schedule, it’s likely you already know how many industry conferences are out there. (And if you haven’t, we’ve rounded up a few of them for you, broken down into: alternatives, private real estate, long-only equity, and hedge fund conferences!) But as you plan when and where you’re going to spend your valuable time and money, it’s equally important to know how to get the most out of each conference you attend, so that you can return to the office with a clear list of contacts, next steps, and goals to work through when it’s all over. At Dakota, we’ve attended hundreds of conferences over the years, and held a few of our own along the way. We know what makes or breaks a conference, and with the launch of the new Conferences feature in Dakota Marketplace, we’ve come to know the ins and outs of them. In this article, we’re going to outline eight best practices for investment industry conferences so you can ensure that you’re as prepared as possible for the next few months and beyond. 1. Get in touch with the conference organizer First and foremost, when you’re looking at conferences, whether you’re a brand or a boutique, it’s important to get in touch with the conference organizer and build a relationship with them. This will help you better understand who the potential attendees are, what a sponsorship would cost, the rules around those sponsorships, as well as just building good will and rapport with the conference organizer. Additionally, conference organizers can often provide you with an attendee list and other key information including: when to arrive, what materials to bring, who is going to be in the audience, any potential speaking opportunities, and more. 2. Start reaching out to attendees before the conference Doing outreach before the conference itself will help ensure that you make the most of the time you have while you’re there. A simple invitation email can read something like this: “I’ll be at [Conference Name] on [date and time], I saw you’ll also be there, would [time] work for you to meet or stop by the booth?” This preemptive outreach provides you with a head start on getting meetings with the right people. The same logic applies for the people you already know, too. Conferences are a great opportunity to continue building a relationship, so be sure to reach out to those already in your network as well. Finally, setting follow up meetings with the contacts you reach out to initially will be a must once the conference. We’ll dive into exactly how to do this later. 3. Put your down time to use If you’re a fund manager who has been to any industry conferences, you know that there is often a few hours between speakers, events, etc., that leave you with some down time. While this can be used for additional networking, it can also be a great time to slip away from the conference floor and fit a few more outside meetings into your day. If you have the agenda in advance of the conference, start reaching out to allocators in that city, leave for an hour or two and do a meeting and then return for the duration of the conference. At Dakota, we’re constantly talking about the importance of city scheduling: the practice of setting as many meetings as you can while you’re traveling to a certain city. This is no different if you’re traveling for a conference. Use that down time to find an additional person to meet with, making your trip even more productive. 4. Be massively prepared with your firm’s messaging and goals When you go to a conference, there are going to be all types of attendees in the audience – clients you might have money with, high school and college interns there to learn, small and large advisors, fund managers, consultants, and more. Because there will be such a wide and varied audience, it’s important that you arrive fully prepared with your story, strategy, and pitch completely nailed down. Get your pitch really dialed in and ready to essentially host multiple five-minute meetings. When you’re working on your pitch, remember to focus on what matters most. What do you want these people to walk away with when they leave your booth? Distill that down into no more than a 3-5 minute conversation. 5. Have a killer follow-up system When the conference ends, you’re going to have a million business cards and potential new contacts – be sure to get all of them into your CRM, follow up, send thank you notes, and set meetings with people who showed interest in your strategy. Taking the contacts and getting them into your CRM to schedule a meeting within a week or two while the information is still fresh can be critical in the days and weeks after a conference. Some conferences have over a thousand attendees, with everyone drinking from a firehose of networking and information; it’s best to act while the information is as memorable as possible. At Dakota, strong follow up is in our DNA. For more tips on exactly how to build a killer follow up system, check out our three-step guide to following up after a meeting. 6. Make sure your booth is eye-catching If you have a table at the conference, be sure you have everything ready to go in advance of the event. This includes everything from marketing materials and collateral, fact sheets, business cards, and in some cases, a nice giveaway item. The Dakota team likes to have golf balls on hand, but there are countless other giveaway items that might work for your firm. Finally, make sure your table looks professional and eye-catching. This could be anything from a nice, branded table skirt, to a backdrop, and more. 7. Prepare for potential sponsorships If a particular conference really stands out to you, you can also pursue a conference sponsorship. We recommend working with the conference organizer to know the sponsorship amount, how it fits in with your budget, the benefits of sponsoring, and whether or not a sponsorship comes with the opportunity for a small speaking role. If the sponsorship does allow for a speaking engagement, it’s important to know the audience ahead of time to ensure you have the right speaker for the audience in front of you. 8. Take advantage of networking time Finally, take full advantage of the networking time the event provides! Engage with people, put yourself out there, both in break-out sessions and out on the floor itself. We always recommend that you reach out and connect with as many people as you can. Again, when you’re networking it’s imperative that you have your messaging really locked in, as you’ll only have a few minutes with each person, and you want to make a memorable impression. Find the right investment industry conference for your firm In investment sales, everything starts with knowing who to call on, and focusing on what matters most. That applies to choosing the right conferences to attend, too. Dakota Marketplace now offers a Conferences functionality, listing out 150+ investment industry conferences, with more added every day.

# article_386_top-10-institutional-asset-allocation-trends-to-wa

{'title': 'Top 10 Institutional Asset Allocation Trends to Watch in 2021', 'introduction': 'With the new year underway and the return to business complete, you’re no doubt feeling the pressure to increase this, enhance that, and better yourself and your business in every possible way. It comes with the territory of the new year, and we know how exhausting those “trends” lists can get. We’re all staring down at phones bursting with must read trends of the new year, especially within a space as broad as institutional investments. So, we did the work for you. Dakota has been in the institutional investment industry since 2006, and we have a knack for knowing what to pay attention to, and when to tune out the noise. In this article, we’ve compiled the top 10 industry trends to keep your eye on throughout 2021. We broke it down into the top 5 institutional allocator industry trends, and the top 5 institutional allocator investment trends, giving you the full scope. By the end of this post, you’ll have a well-rounded understanding of what’s to come in the new year, so that your team can be as prepared as possible. The top 5 institutional allocator industry trends 1. Diversity and Inclusion is front of mind As institutional commitment to diversity and inclusion (D&I) has continued to grow, the approach allocators have taken towards those efforts has evolved. Gatekeepers are increasingly evaluating managers on their proven commitment to D&I initiatives, which Includes enhanced, ongoing reporting, benchmarking of progress against stated goals, and investment programs dedicated to funding emerging and established D&I managers. Regardless of channel, a deep understanding of the nuances of each individual program will be integral to success going forward. 2. The home office continues to grow in influence – and drive assets Continuing a trend seen over the last several years, wealth managers are increasingly adopting a centralized approach to manager selection and model allocation. This allows account executives to focus on client acquisition and retention while ensuring that clients are provided with the firm’s best thinking. This change is disrupting the traditional wholesaling approach and forcing investment management firms to refocus efforts on key gatekeepers and the home office. 3. Institutional consultants will expand their reach into wealth management While once primarily key gatekeepers of endowments, foundations, pensions, and other institutional investors, consultants have increasingly expanded their reach into the RIA and wealth management intermediary channels. Recognizing the unparalleled scale and scope that consultants can provide, large wealth managers are turning to consultants as a cost-effective way of outsourcing initial and ongoing investment and operational due diligence. This trend accelerates a deep understanding of each consultant’s process, and therefore their client base is imperative for the investment sales professionals across channels. 4. Adoption of alternative platforms as a comprehensive solution continues As interest in alternative investment strategies has grown among high and ultra-high net worth clients, these investment platforms have emerged as key players in the democratization of alternatives. Alternative platforms solve key problems for allocators such as streamlining the subscription process, consolidating reporting, and lowering minimums. As allocators large and small turn to platforms as a comprehensive solution for their alternative programs, knowledge of not only the key players but how they work with allocators and managers is critical. 5. Within the wealth management channel, the only constant is change As anyone in the RIA space knows, the channel remains in a constant cycle of disintermediation and consolidation, with successful teams increasingly leaving the larger bank platforms only to be acquired later. As fee compression continues, RIAs are increasingly reliant on scale to provide the scope of services that wealth management clients demand. This dynamic demands that investment sales professionals have a comprehensive understanding of the entire wealth management channel, not just a focus on the largest allocators, to be successful. The top 5 institutional allocator investment trends 6. Virtual due diligence is here to stay With the recent roll-out of two viable vaccines, the investment management industry has breathed a collective sigh of relief that the world may return to normal. However, for both investment sales professionals and due diligence analysts, the current method of virtual due diligence is likely here to stay. Investment and operational due diligence at firms both large and small have indicated a willingness, and in many cases even a preference, to conduct due diligence virtually. While onsite visits will likely never be completely eliminated, the transition to a virtual approach will likely decrease hurdles and time to add new products. 7. In the search for yield, investors turn to alternative credit In a world of persistently low interest rates, rather than stretching down the credit spectrum, allocators are increasingly turning to private and opportunistic credit to increase current yield and total return to clients. Allocators are finding that, with a relatively limited increase in duration, clients can access higher quality credits with substantially higher expected returns. This tradeoff between liquidity and returns is one institutional allocators (and their clients) are more than willing to make. 8. Allocator attention to digital assets continues to rise Whether as a result of the meteoric rise in digital assets, concerns about inflation, or general curiosity about the asset class, allocators are once again looking for investments across the digital ecosystem. What was once the near exclusive domain of sophisticated family offices has now proliferated across channels, with investors from banks to large insurance companies increasingly making sizable investments in digital assets. Many observers of the space have indicated that the next year or so will be crucial in understanding whether this trend is here to stay. 9. Investors are (gradually) returning to real estate strategies Many allocators who moved quickly to halt or reduce real estate investment are surveying a 2021 landscape with a renewed interest in the opportunity set. As a new normal returns, allocators are finding that they can acquire real estate equity and debt of higher quality and credit at a better price. This has prompted allocators off the sidelines to take a new (or renewed) look at the asset class. 10. Interest in private equity remains high, with co-investment quality and volume a deciding factor for allocators As institutional allocators continue to look to private equity as a source of return, enhanced access to quality co-investment deal flow has gone from a “nice to have” to a “need to have.” Co-investment is increasingly seen as a necessary component of private equity programs not only to reduce overall fees, but to enhance investor returns. This has benefited managers with proven access to quality deals, and a proven ability to execute on behalf of investors. How to make the most of a year full of change While 2020 threw a wrench into many plans, as you’ve seen above, 2021 promises to have its own list of changes in store. With returns to old strategies, a move to virtual due diligence, and a renewed interest in specific asset classes, allocators will need to keep their finger on the pulse as things continue to change over the course of the year. Staying in contact with other allocators and investors within the industry is a critical way to stay engaged until things (slowly) return to normal.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'Top 10 Institutional Asset Allocation Trends to Watch in 2021', 'content': 'With the new year underway and the return to business complete, you’re no doubt feeling the pressure to increase this, enhance that, and better yourself and your business in every possible way.

# article_211_how-to-leverage-cold-calling-in-investment-sales

{'title': 'How to Leverage Cold Calling in Investment Sales', 'introduction': "Cold calling is an intimidating task, especially if you haven’t made any before. As a salesperson, you cannot have the fear of rejection. It’s important to have a goldfish mentality - forget about it after five seconds and move onto the next call. A lot of the time with sales you are receiving no over and over again. At Dakota, we like to say “become a professional meeting setter-upper.” The only way to do this is practicing your pitch over and over again until you can recite it in your sleep. We have been doing this for 20+ years, and know a few things about cold outreach and being addicted to setting up meetings. In this article, we are teaching you how to successfully complete a cold call, as well as the factors you need to include in your pitch. By the end of this, you’ll have an idea for how to create your own script for cold calling. The Script The first thing to keep in mind when you're cold calling is that due diligence analysts get hundreds of calls and emails a day. This is why your script needs to be short and to the point. For the beginning of the cold call, you can't go off script. Once you get out the first 10 to 15 seconds, then you really need to be prepared for what is next. So, you dial the phone and the analyst picks up. Introduce yourself and say the firm you’re calling from. For the sake of explaining, we’ll use Dakota as an example. “Hello, my name is Gui Costin from Dakota. We’ve never spoken before.” Move on to explain what your product and strategy is in order to draw them in. “Our firm partners with a select group of boutique investment managers across long only equity and private alternatives. I will be in Boston on October 30th, can you meet at 9am?” That's it. That's your cold call. The analyst will most likely say something along the lines of, “Tell me a little bit more about your firm,” before they agree to a meeting. This is where it's so important that you get in front of a mirror and practice, so you’re fully prepared to answer the follow up questions. Differentiating Factors The key is to know what makes your product, or what you’re cold calling about, different. Once you say your first differentiator you should hope that you don’t need other factors because you want it to be so impactful. One for example would be saying who is invested in our products… “Our partner funds are used by over 800 investment firms globally, by some of the largest foundations, endowments, consultants, banks / broker-dealers, RIAs and leading family offices”; we pack a punch with that statement. The end of your call should be asking for a meeting. Keep this short and to the point. “I'm going to be in Boston on August 24th. Can you meet at 9:00 AM?” After concluding the call, or maybe just leaving a voicemail, send an email to follow up 5 minutes after the call so you have a few touch points in with this salesperson you’re trying to get a hold of. Sales is an emotional job. Once you get your practice in, you’ll become more comfortable and realize it’s not personal when someone tells you no or even hangs up during your pitch. The next cold call you make could be the one that lands you your next meeting.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'How to Leverage Cold Calling in Investment Sales', 'content': "Cold calling is an intimidating task, especially if you haven’t made any before.

# article_340_3-tips-for-presenting-to-a-public-pension-board

{'title': '3 Tips for Presenting to a Public Pension Board', 'introduction': 'Walking into a board meeting to pitch a final presentation to the public pension board can be intimidating to say the least. If you\'re in investment sales, you already know that almost no one looks forward to these meetings: they can be stressful, difficult, and tend to be very, very long. So how can you, as the investment salesperson, step into that meeting and present your pitch without putting all the board members to sleep? The key is preparation. If you come prepared, you won\'t have to worry. At Dakota, our investment sales team has been fundraising since 2006, and we\'ve given our fair share of final presentations in that time. Because of this, we\'ve narrowed down exactly what works and what doesn\'t, and have used these strategies to help raise over $40 billion. In this article, we’ll discuss how to present to a public pension board, whether it\'s during a final presentation or on an update call for investment firms. We\'ll tell you how to structure the meeting, as well as what your presentation should include. After reading this article, you’ll have a clear understanding of how to present yourself and your firm, as well as how to deliver the strongest pitch possible. Presenting to the public pension board When presenting a final to a public pension fund board and it\'s been a long meeting, it can feel like a parade of investment firms. This means you need to be cognizant of a number of things. First, while the people in the room with you are very intelligent, without context they have no clue what you\'re talking about. What does this mean for you? It means that it\'s critical that you keep your presentation simple and to the point. The analysts in the room have seen countless presentations and, chances are, they\'re starting to blur. Most portfolio managers and marketing associates will go on and on, trying to cover every single thing about themselves and their firm that they possibly can. That is not what you want to do. Now, we\'ll jump into what you should do in presentations like this. 1. Offer a firm overview At Dakota, our advice is to always give a strong firm overview. Tell them what they need to hear to feel comfortable with you. There\'s always going to be a consultant at the table that’s going to ask you questions when you’re finished, but it’s critical to get your story out. As the marketing associate, you could introduce the firm and give a background. You could then turn it over to the portfolio manager to describe at a very high level what they do and how they do it, but try to keep it to five minutes. If you’re thinking that this sounds crazy, or wondering how you\'re supposed to win them over by telling them what we do in less than 5 minutes? Don’t panic. Most board members have to sit through these meetings and listen to portfolio managers drone on and on, and they\'ve done it for years. They\'re going to end up loving the person who gets quickly to the point and respects their time. 2. Leave the Q&A to the consultants We know how this sounds, but leaving the question and answer period to the consultants isn\'t as daunting as it sounds. And, it doesn\'t mean that you won\'t have time to answer questions after your pitch. Once you finish your five minute presentation, the consultant will think, "Oh, you know what? I\'m glad they finished. Everyone\'s still awake. And I\'m going to start to ask questions." Cover the salient points of your firm and your investment strategy so the board members have a good feel for who you are and what you do - leave it at that. Let the consultant do the Q&A. Presenting in an update meeting 3. Be prepared and know the material In an update meeting, the structure is very similar to a presentation meeting. Make sure you always review your investment strategy during an update call. Be thoughtful of what you’re going to say and respect their time. Below is an example of what you’d say on the call: "Hello, my name is Gui Costin from Edgewood Management. As you know, we manage a portfolio of exactly 22 large cap growth stocks. We consider the companies that we invest in to have high quality characteristics. We’re invested in companies that make a lot of money, have little or no debt, have a really competitive market position, have a great management team, have high and increasing margins, and recurring revenue. These are characteristics we want to see in our companies. If you’re analyzing us, Edgewood is very different because we disparate the portfolio based upon valuation. We have our most attractive, valued stocks as our 5, 6, 7, 8% positions. This is because if they do the best during any given year, we can really generate outperformance." Let\'s break down the example above. First, start by introducing the strategy. Next, talk about what happened during the quarter and be very prepared - the buys, the sells - and try to keep it very tight to the point without rushing. You don\'t want or need to give a long or drawn out overview for 15 or 25 minutes. There\'s just not enough to say, and you don\'t need to fill the room. Give them the update of what they need to know about the quarter, and then pause and say, "You know what? I\'ll just stop there," and see if there\'s any questions."', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': '3 Tips for Presenting to a Public Pension Board', 'content': 'Walking into a board meeting to pitch a final presentation to the public pension board can be intimidating to say the least. If you\'re in investment sales, you already know that almost no one looks forward to these meetings: they can be stressful, difficult, and tend to be very, very long. So how can you, as the investment salesperson, step into that meeting and present your pitch without putting all the board members to sleep? The key is preparation. If you come prepared, you won\'t have to worry. At Dakota, our investment sales team has been fundraising since 2006, and we\'ve given our fair share of final presentations in that time. Because of this, we\'ve narrowed down exactly what works and what doesn\'t, and have used these strategies to help raise over $40 billion. In this article, we’ll discuss how to present to a public pension board, whether it\'s during a final presentation or on an update call for investment firms. We\'ll tell you how to structure the meeting, as well as what your presentation should include. After reading this article, you’ll have a clear understanding of how to present yourself and your firm, as well as how to deliver the strongest pitch possible. Presenting to the public pension board When presenting a final to a public pension fund board and it\'s been a long meeting, it can feel like a parade of investment firms. This means you need to be cognizant of a number of things. First, while the people in the room with you are very intelligent, without context they have no clue what you\'re talking about. What does this mean for you? It means that it\'s critical that you keep your presentation simple and to the point. The analysts in the room have seen countless presentations and, chances are, they\'re starting to blur. Most portfolio managers and marketing associates will go on and on, trying to cover every single thing about themselves and their firm that they possibly can. That is not what you want to do. Now, we\'ll jump into what you should do in presentations like this. 1. Offer a firm overview At Dakota, our advice is to always give a strong firm overview. Tell them what they need to hear to feel comfortable with you. There\'s always going to be a consultant at the table that’s going to ask you questions when you’re finished, but it’s critical to get your story out. As the marketing associate, you could introduce the firm and give a background. You could then turn it over to the portfolio manager to describe at a very high level what they do and how they do it, but try to keep it to five minutes. If you’re thinking that this sounds crazy, or wondering how you\'re supposed to win them over by telling them what we do in less than 5 minutes? Don’t panic. Most board members have to sit through these meetings and listen to portfolio managers drone on and on, and they\'ve done it for years. They\'re going to end up loving the person who gets quickly to the point and respects their time. 2. Leave the Q&A to the consultants We know how this sounds, but leaving the question and answer period to the consultants isn\'t as daunting as it sounds. And, it doesn\'t mean that you won\'t have time to answer questions after your pitch. Once you finish your five minute presentation, the consultant will think, "Oh, you know what? I\'m glad they finished. Everyone\'s still awake. And I\'m going to start to ask questions." Cover the salient points of your firm and your investment strategy so the board members have a good feel for who you are and what you do - leave it at that. Let the consultant do the Q&A. Presenting in an update meeting 3. Be prepared and know the material In an update meeting, the structure is very similar to a presentation meeting. Make sure you always review your investment strategy during an update call. Be thoughtful of what you’re going to say and respect their time. Below is an example of what you’d say on the call: "Hello, my name is Gui Costin from Edgewood Management. As you know, we manage a portfolio of exactly 22 large cap growth stocks. We consider the companies that we invest in to have high quality characteristics. We’re invested in companies that make a lot of money, have little or no debt, have a really competitive market position, have a great management team, have high and increasing margins, and recurring revenue. These are characteristics we want to see in our companies. If you’re analyzing us, Edgewood is very different because we disparate the portfolio based upon valuation. We have our most attractive, valued stocks as our 5, 6, 7, 8% positions. This is because if they do the best during any given year, we can really generate outperformance." Let\'s break down the example above. First, start by introducing the strategy. Next, talk about what happened during the quarter and be very prepared - the buys, the sells - and try to keep it very tight to the point without rushing. You don\'t want or need to give a long or drawn out overview for 15 or 25 minutes. There\'s just not enough to say, and you don\'t need to fill the room. Give them the update of what they need to know about the quarter, and then pause and say, "You know what? I\'ll just stop there," and see if there\'s any questions."', 'bullet_points': [], 'subsections': []}], 'key_takeaways': [], 'faqs': []}

# article_049_stop-guessing-start-closing-how-pipeline-reports-c

{'title': 'Stop Guessing, Start Closing: How Pipeline Reports Can Transform Your Sales', 'introduction': 'Let’s be real, if there’s one thing investment salespeople universally dread, it’s logging meetings into a CRM. It’s tedious, time-consuming, and feels like it pulls you away from the “real” work of connecting with clients. But here’s the catch: without those logs, you’re flying blind. Imagine scrolling through endless emails, shuffling through your memory (and maybe even those old sticky notes), trying to piece together where each deal stands. Not ideal, right? The truth is, logging meetings in your CRM is the key to generating pipeline opportunity reports that do all the heavy lifting for you. These reports turn all that data into something actionable, letting you see every opportunity’s stage, priority, and next steps – all with one click. So, yes, logging meetings may feel like a hassle. But when it unlocks a clear, structured pipeline report that maps out your sales strategy in real-time? It’s worth every keystroke. In this article we are going over the pipeline opportunity report and it’s necessity. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of how it will give you that big-picture view of your deals and take the guesswork out of your sales process. What Is a Pipeline Opportunity Report, Really? In plain terms, a pipeline opportunity report is just a fancy way of saying "who we’re talking to and how close they are to signing on the dotted line." Each entry represents a potential deal, complete with details like Firm Name, Opportunity Name, AUM, Product, Stage, Account Type, Contact Info, and a few custom fields for Current Status and Next Steps. Basically, it’s your one-stop shop for every potential opportunity, in order, so you’re never left wondering, “What was I supposed to do next with that client?” The trick is to sort by stage, which is just a fancy way of saying put the hottest deals up top. Your high-priority opportunities, the ones closest to closing, go right at the top. The earlier-stage prospects? They get some space further down the list. So every time you check in, the most important stuff is front and center. Now, let’s start with the basics: the general pipeline report. This report captures everything, all channels, all stages, giving you an overview of your entire sales pipeline in one click. Think of it as your “big picture” view. The best part? It’s easy to share with your boss, so they can see exactly where things stand without you having to launch into a lengthy recap. We cannot stress enough that these pipeline reports aren’t just about tracking deals, they’re a way to keep your boss in the loop, and not in that vague, “Oh yeah, things are going well” way. With the general pipeline report, you get to show, not tell, exactly what’s going on in your sales world. New call-to-action Targeting Each Channel The general pipeline report is awesome, but if you want to get really strategic, go one step further with channel-specific pipeline reports. Create a pipeline for each major account type—say, Bank/BD, Consultant, and RIA. This way, you’re not just tracking every deal; you’re seeing exactly how each segment is performing. Focusing on these specific segments helps you understand which products and strategies resonate most with each group, so you’re not just throwing spaghetti at the wall but are strategically targeting what works best for each type. Channel-specific reports mean you’re not treating all prospects the same. You’re taking a tailored, precise approach, which means better-targeted outreach and (hopefully) more closed deals. Using Pipeline Reports as Your Weekly Check-In Buddy Pipeline reports aren’t just for tracking deals—they’re your weekly update cheat sheet. If you’re wondering how to keep your boss in the loop without hours of prep work, pipeline reports are it. When it’s time for your update meeting, these reports give you a complete view of all opportunities at a glance, from deals in progress to those right on the edge of closing. The Current Status and Next Steps fields make it easy to outline what’s happening with each deal and what action is needed next. At Dakota, we emphasize that when everyone has access to the pipeline report, you’re all on the same page without any need for extra clarifications. It’s a “look, here’s the plan” moment with zero guesswork. This way, you don’t have to remember everything off the top of your head or scramble to write down updates. Instead, you’ve got everything ready to go, letting you and your boss stay aligned without a ton of extra effort. Here’s where the magic happens. When you’re consistently reviewing and updating your pipeline reports, you’re not just staying organized—you’re setting yourself up for sales success. Over time, these reports reveal patterns and trends in your sales cycle, showing you what works and where you might need to pivot. Making Pipeline Reports the Foundation of Your Sales Strategy To make pipeline reports a core part of your sales strategy, it’s all about consistency and focus: Review Regularly: Block out time each week to check your pipeline reports. Make it a habit, like checking your inbox. Your future self will thank you. Set Priorities: The report’s structure lets you instantly see which deals need attention. Focus on high-value opportunities and keep those “maybe” prospects warm for later. Track and Adjust: Over time, your pipeline report will reveal which tactics and patterns work best. Use these insights to fine-tune your approach, making your strategy stronger with every review. Pipeline reports might not seem thrilling, but they’re the easiest way to bring structure to your sales process. With a single click, you’ll have a clear, actionable view of every opportunity—no guesswork, no “wait, wasn’t I supposed to follow up?” Instead, you have a real-time roadmap that shows where to focus and who to contact next. By making these reports part of your routine, you’re not just keeping your CRM organized—you’re setting up your pipeline for success. Embrace the simplicity and structure they offer, and watch as every lead transforms into a genuine opportunity, and every opportunity has a clear path to close.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'Stop Guessing, Start Closing: How Pipeline Reports Can Transform Your Sales', 'content': 'Let’s be real, if there’s one thing investment salespeople universally dread, it’s logging meetings into a CRM.

{'title': 'April 2023 Financial Advisor and RIA Moves and Acquisitions', 'introduction': 'Regional banking news continued to occupy the headlines through March and continued to be a deciding factor for FA’s as evaluated what firms they wanted to partner with. In the wires Morgan Stanley and UBS continued to experience large recruiting wins as teams from First Republic departed and sought firms with banking capabilities. On the RIA/independent side, Cresset and Rockefeller have been the strongest in attracting Teams this year. That said, LPL was very active in April and could pull ahead should this momentum continue. In the midst of all of the mergers and acquisitions we have seen over the past two years, we are seeing more comments via financials earnings calls on focusing on organic growth and marketing efforts, essentially getting back to the basics. The same has been said on the RIA side with many business brokers stating that RIAs should not forget about their core business of managing and growing their client base, and not manage themselves to be acquired at a premium. Due to the amount of movement during April, we have separated this month’s update into two segments. Independents and Banks: Ricky Smith has established a new team name" Inspired Wealth Planning" and joined Kestra Private Wealth with $200 M AUM based in Cordele, GA. Previously with Edward Jones. Decker, Harth, & Swavely (FAs: Jonathan Decker, David Harth, and Jonathan Swavely)  with $450 M AUM based in St. Petersburg, FL have joined Janney.  The Team will be the anchor of the new office for Janney as they continue their Florida expansion. Prev with Merrill Lynch. CG Advisor Network (led by: Anthony J. Mazzali, 74 FAs total) in Haslett, MI with $3.1 B AUM has joined LPL as their platform and RIA custodian. Prev were with TDA and Geneos Wealth. Financial Design Group based in Toledo, OH managing $850 M AUM has joined LPL. The Team includes 14 FAs and is led by Mike Clements and Jason Strasser and will be dually registered at LPL. They were originally with Securian, which was recently purchased by Cetera. Post Securian purchase, there have been a number of FA’s that have departed Cetera. Kemp Cunningham, new team name "Emerald River Wealth Management" with $125 M AUM in Granger, IN has joined LPL. Prev with Edward Jones. One2One Wealth Strategies (FAs: Austin Adams, Greg Geryak, Austin Sigrist, Stephanie Schultz, Jeff Edwards and George Fraunces) in Scottsdale, AZ with $400 M AUM has joined Mariner Advisors with LPL. They departed PlanMember Securities. Sheehan Wealth Partners (FAs James Sheehan and Shawn Tighe) based in Daniel Island, SC managing $450 M AUM have joined the LPL independent channel (LPL Strategic Wealth Services) . Their client base has focused on energy executives. The Team was previously with Raymond James. Nick Lalonde, new team name Third Act Wealth Management based in Dallas, TX with $200 M AUM has joined LPL. Prev with Edward Jones. SC Financial Group (FAs: Robert Davis, Rumesh Senanayake and Alex Carter) based in Bellevue, WA managing $220 M AUM has joined LPL. Prev with Cadaret Grant. Eric Gallinger in Irvine, CA who manages $300 M AUM has joined Stratos Wealth Partners/ LPL.  Prev with Merrill Lynch. Carnegie Private Wealth, a new team led by Angie Ostendarp, Jordan Raniszeski, Mary Sherrill Ware, and Mitch Mayfield have joined LPL Strategic Wealth Services in Charlotte, NC with $1.45 B AUM.  They will now be the largest Team in the LPL SWS platform. The Team was previously with Wells. Timothy Lanier based in Neptune Beach, FL managing $300 M AUM has joined LPL. His Team, Lanier Wealth Management will continue to focus on healthcare professionals. Prev with Valic. Walker Alston Financial Group (FAS: Stephen Walker and Wes Alston) in San Antonio, TX have joined LPL managing $200 M AUM. Previously with Securities America. Todd Halbrook, Adam MacDonald and Vince Lovoy (new team name: Todd Halbrook and Adam MacDonald Wealth Management Group) have joined RBC Wealth in Newport Beach, CA with $1B AUM.  They have departed First Republic where they were under the "Lovoy, MacDonald and Halbrook Group". The Team was ranked 38th on Forbes’ best-in-state wealth advisors in 2023. MP approved. Eric M.

On the RIA/independent side, Cresset and Rockefeller have been the strongest in attracting Teams this year. That said, LPL was very active in April and could pull ahead should this momentum continue. In the midst of all of the mergers and acquisitions we have seen over the past two years, we are seeing more comments via financials earnings calls on focusing on organic growth and marketing efforts, essentially getting back to the basics. The same has been said on the RIA side with many business brokers stating that RIAs should not forget about their core business of managing and growing their client base, and not manage themselves to be acquired at a premium.

# article_346_the-top-13f-filing-databases-whalewisdom-vs-opport

{'title': 'The Top 13F Filing Databases: Whalewisdom vs. Opportunity Hunter vs. SEC-API', 'introduction': "If you sell in the RIA channel, you already know that there are no shortage of firms to call on within the United States. However, you probably also know how difficult it is to determine which are the right fit for your firm and your strategy. You probably feel like you’re shooting in the dark when you’re doing outreach. We know, we’ve been there too. At Dakota, we’ve been fundraising for our partners since 2006, and have raised over $40 billion in that time. We’re no strangers to the RIA channel and the challenges that lie within it. What’s more, we know that knowing who to call on can make or break your outreach strategy. However, in that time, we’ve also come to learn that when it comes to RIAs, knowing where they’re investing before you call on them can save your sales team a lot of time. Which is why, in this article, we’re going to outline three of the primary resources for information on 13F filings, which allow your team to know where RIAs are investing. We’re going to include our own new, 13F Filing platform at the end of this list as well, but don’t worry, we’re not here to convince you that our product is the only solution for you. Instead, our goal is to give you an overview of all four platforms, so that you can evaluate for yourself which is the best fit for your team. These platforms include: Whalewisdom Broadridge Opportunity Hunter SEC-API Dakota Marketplace 13F filings By the end of the article, you’ll have a better idea which platform is right for your firm, so that you can start making more meaningful, targeted outreach to RIAs. Whalewisdom Overview Whalewisdom was founded on the belief that there is value in learning from the “whales” of the stock market. They believe that everyone has something to learn from their peers, and the big firms and players within the industry. To that end, Whalewisdom has several options for users to choose from, including a product dedicated to 13F filings. In addition to this, though, they have the Whalescore, which allows users to quickly identify funds with the best chance of outperforming the market in the future, and the Whaleindex, which takes the best funds and creates a portfolio of their most commonly held stocks. However, for the purposes of this article, we’re going to focus on the 13F Backtester, which allows users to see how cloning a fund or group of fund’s top holdings would have performed in the past, as well as the Excel 13F Holdings Extension. How is the data obtained and managed? WhaleWisdom.com SEC filing data collection is done in-house and is entirely automated with little to no human intervention. Because of this, there is a margin for error, and Whalewisdom does advise that users take and use the information at their own risk. How much does it cost? Whalewisdom starts at a free tier, which allows you to access 13F filings from the past two years, as well as receive email alerts, backtesting, and reporting tools. From there, they move into paid options, which start at $90/three months, or $300/year. Additional features As mentioned above, Whalewisdom offers a variety of additional tools, including Whalescore, Whaleindex, the 13F Excel Extension, as well as dashboards. Opportunity Hunter Overview Broadridge is a global Fintech leader that provides communications, technology, data and analytics. Their product, Opportunity Hunter, consolidates, scores, and analyzes data from multiple sources, presenting these insights in a simple user interface. Opportunity Hunter identifies opportunities by comparing your product characteristics against other products held by a prospect. How is the data obtained and managed? Opportunity Hunter compiles 200 data points from Morningstar and compiles them all in one place. How much does it cost? Pricing information is not available on the Broadridge site, but can be obtained through a demo. Additional features Opportunity Hunter is specific to helping investment sales teams identify which firms are a fit for their strategy, and the product is hyper-focused on this functionality. SEC-API Overview SEC Filings API is a platform that makes SEC filings accessible and analyzable to everyone. SEC API provides four types of APIs: query, full-text search, real-time stream and a HTML/PDF render API. This platform has over 18 million filings available, from 1993 to now. Additionally, SEC-API has built proprietary algorithms to discover and index new filings in less than 200 milliseconds after publication on SEC.gov. How is the data obtained and managed? SEC-API pulls filing data directly from SEC.gov. How much does it cost? SEC-API starts at a free tier, allowing users 100 API calls free of charge. Then, the pricing starts at $49/month for the Research platform, or $199/month for Resell platform. Additional features SEC-API provides a lot of features for the benefit of investment sales teams, including access to all 150 SEC filing types, indexed in real-time, with every filing mapped to its company ticker. Additionally, you have the option to try the product in SEC-API’s own sandbox, so you have the opportunity to try the platform before making a commitment. Dakota Marketplace 13F Filings Overview The Dakota 13F Filings is an upcoming Dakota product that is run through SEC-API, meaning that the data comes through an API to Dakota. The Dakota data team ensures the accuracy of the files received, and provides them to our clients. How is the data obtained and managed? Dakota receives the data via SEC-API, directly from SEC.gov. How much does it cost? Dakota 13F Filings is part of Dakota Marketplace, which is $13,500 per user per year. Request a free trial from our team to see if it's a fit for your firm. Additional features The Dakota 13F Filings platform coincides with a full Marketplace membership, including, among other features, Dakota Live! Calls, Dakota Searches, and Investment Committee Meeting Notes, so you’re always up-to-date on industry changes and news. Which platform is right for your firm? Now that we’ve covered four platforms dedicated to helping your firm access 13F and other filings, you might be wondering which one is right for you. While this comes down to the intentions and needs of your sales team and firm, we do think we can provide some insight on which might be the best fit in certain cases. If you… Want deep insights with a visual comparison of how your firm’s strategy compares to current RIA investments, Whalewisdom or Opportunity Hunter might be the best choices for you. If you want direct access to filings as they are being done, access to filings from 1993 and beyond, then SEC-API would be a good fit for you. If you are a current Dakota Marketplace member, the Dakota 13F Filings platform would be a great addition to your Dakota membership.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'The Top 13F Filing Databases: Whalewisdom vs. Opportunity Hunter vs. SEC-API', 'content': "If you sell in the RIA channel, you already know that there are no shortage of firms to call on within the United States.

# article_065_how-to-optimize-your-public-pension-fund-research

{'title': 'How To Optimize Your Public Pension Fund Research', 'introduction': "If you're in institutional sales selling to public pension funds or consultants, you’ve probably experienced the frustration of trying to keep up with public pension fund activity. It’s not uncommon to spend hours jumping from one pension website to another, downloading meeting minutes, and sorting through pages of information to find what you need.

# article_371_public-pension-fund-investment-strategy-3-tips-to

{'title': 'Public Pension Fund Investment Strategy: 3 Tips to Know Before Calling', 'introduction': 'Building relationships with public pension funds can be a difficult undertaking. The space is so broad, and contains so many decision makers at every level, from government organizations to outside consultants. This makes it tough to know who is managing public pension funds, or what they are currently invested in. At Dakota, one of our core principles is to always know what to say and who to call on. But with so many layers of involvement, knowing who to call on at a public pension fund can feel impossible. This is because in many cases, the people making decisions at a pension don’t necessarily work there, like they might at other types of firms. U.S. Pension funds rely on a combination of outside investment consulting firms and in-house investment committees to conduct due diligence on potential fund investments. Pensions often have multiple investment consultants specializing in different asset classes, i.e - Private Equity, Real Estate, Hedge Funds. Our team has committed to cataloging these specific relationships both at the firm and field consultant levels to remove the complexity of approaching Public Pension funds, making it easier for you to access the people and information you need. As we’ve continued to compile this information in our weekly Public Pensions Brief, we wanted to share some of the common themes that can be found among public pension fund investments. In this article, we’ll outline three key things you need to know about how public pension funds invest. By the end of the article, you’ll have the knowledge you need to get started accessing the public pension fund market. 1. Public pensions have specific manager requirements While specific requirements can vary depending on the fund, there are a few similarities that hold true across the majority of public pension funds. A solid track record. Most funds prefer a manager that has been in the field for at least 3-5 years. Manager Size. Many public pensions funds require a manager to have a minimum of $500M in a specific strategy. Additionally, some pension funds have investor concentration limits (i.e it can’t make up too much of the total fund’s percentage). Team Continuity. Public pension funds tend to prefer senior executives and key employees who have worked together for years, rather than a team with a high rate of turnover. Diverse client base. Many larger plans want their managers to have other Public Pension clients in their portfolios. This helps ensure that you can understand the disclosure requirements. 2. You’ll need a clear picture of a pension fund’s historical and current investments More insights into their history allows for a more tailored sales approach. At Dakota, we maintain detailed investment records for these Pension funds. We catalog current and historical fund manager relationships, asset class, commitment amounts, funding dates, and IRR among others, sortable by multiple fields, so that we always have a clear picture of a particular fund’s investment. 3. Public pension funds utilize emerging manager platforms and investment consultants Knowing ahead of time if a fund is utilizing an emerging manager platform, an investment consultant, or both, can make building the relationship easier. Does the plan have an Emerging Manager Platform? This is a way to still get access to public pension capital if you don’t meet all necessary requirements. These platforms provide access for newer managers, and gives new and/or smaller managers a shot at managing money for pensions. Which investment consultants does the plan utilize? Who are the dedicated field consultants for the plan? How are manager due diligence responsibilities divided? Some public pensions outsource almost everything, which means that it doesn’t benefit you as a salesperson to reach out to a pension if they’re not making any in-house decisions. How to bring it all together It all boils down to two key things: know what to say, and know who to call on. Before you make a call or start doing outreach, you have to be sure that the fund you’re interested in allocates to and works with outside managers. Knowing this ahead of time will save your team time and effort. Additionally, knowing what to say by having a clear picture of the fund’s historical investments will also ensure that you’re successful. Start by doing your research. If you’re not sure where to start, Dakota’s Public Pension Fund Investment Brief is a great place to start, and offers weekly insight and takeaways from public pension fund monthly meetings.

{'title': 'Dakota Studios: What Does it Cost to Shoot Video for Your Firm?', 'introduction': 'Even after years on Zoom, we’ve all had moments where presenting or sharing on video has felt clunky. You’re likely already doing something you’re nervous about, with a “room” full of silent eyes on you — it can feel like a lot of pressure. But, whether you’re well-versed in video or new to it, there’s always room for improvement.

Since the launch of Dakota Studios in early 2021, we’ve hammered out all the rough patches, and shot hours and hours of footage for ourselves and others. In that time, we’ve learned the true value of video production. Creating videos can: Increase brand awareness Help others learn about your company mission, vision, and goals Spread the word about a nonprofit Decrease the time your sales team needs to spend answering introductory questions about your firm And more In this article, we’re going to outline how much shooting videos and webinars in Dakota Studios costs. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear understanding of how much your investment will be, and what you’ll come away with at the end of your shoot. Marketing videos About Take the stress out of pitching with professionally shot, easy to distribute marketing videos.

At the end of the day, the videos you create are only useful if they are being used by your sales team to share information about your firm with analysts. However, in our experience, this is not often the case. Typically video is being created and then left untouched, despite the firm making a significant investment in its production. We get it. You know you need to be shooting video and incorporating it into your strategy, and so, like many firms, you find a videographer and do just that. This often results in beautifully shot videos of your building, lobby, and team... without very much substance to work with. This is because — understandably — most videographers don’t know the questions investment allocators want answered, and you’re left with videos that are nicely made but of little use to your sales team. The team at Dakota Studios works hand in hand with our investment sales team to ensure you’re asking and answering the questions due diligence analysts want answered.
