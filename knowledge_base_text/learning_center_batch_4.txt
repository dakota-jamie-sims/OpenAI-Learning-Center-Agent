{'title': '5 Reasons Your Investment Sales Emails Aren’t Getting Read — And How to Fix It', 'introduction': "As the world slowly opens back up and more in-person meetings are being set, it’s important to know how to ask for those meetings. To do that, you’ll have to send an email that not only gets opened, but replied to, which can be a difficult task in a world where everyone is inundated with emails every day. If you’ve struggled with unopened or unanswered emails, you’re not alone. In fact, there are several reasons why this may be the case. After all, if an allocator’s inbox is overloaded with pitches, how do you make yours stand out? It comes down to providing support, and making a genuine connection with the person on the receiving end of that email. From the subject line to the body of the email, everything should have a purpose. At Dakota, we have a dedicated sales team who spends a great deal of time setting up meetings and conference calls, reaching out to clients and prospects, and of course, consistently following up. We’ve overcome the challenges of unopened emails, and want to share some of our best tips and tricks for getting your emails in front of allocators. Sending an email may seem simple, but at the end of the day, whether you’re trying to start a dialogue with a new prospect, or build a relationship with a partner, how you go about it matters. No one wants to be bombarded with information or have something asked of them with no clear next steps. In this article, we’ll outline the five reasons your emails aren’t getting opened or replied to. We’ll also show you the things you can do to change that and start setting more meetings with the right people. After reading this article you’ll be able to send engaging emails that are read. Mistake 1: Your contact information is incomplete or incorrect The easiest way to get your email ignored is to send it to the wrong person. Ensuring that your contact information is up to date and accurate is the first step to ensuring it gets opened and responded to. Solution: Be diligent about your data Make sure that you have not only the appropriate contact information, but the appropriate contact, specific to the asset class that you’re raising capital for. It could be that they’re sending the email to the wrong person who is not responsible for your asset class, or not the person responsible for starting the conversation. Mistake 2: Your subject lines aren’t specific enough Allocators can get hundreds of emails per day, and if the email you’re sending doesn’t have a clear subject line, it could easily get skipped. It’s critical that your subject lines are direct and specific, calling out the strategy you’re introducing, and what you’re asking of them. Solution: Keep it right to the point When doing outreach, the Dakota team includes three key pieces of information in each subject line: the strategy name, the purpose of the email (setting a meeting, reconnecting, etc), and the date you want to meet. This way, the allocator knows exactly what waits for them inside the email. Including the person’s name in the subject line is another way to grab someone’s attention, while making the email feel more personal and stand out that much more in their inbox. In fact, including the person’s name in the subject line can increase open rates by as much as 17%. The Dakota team has found success when including these thoughtful subject lines rather than more general ones — as well as an increase in meetings. Mistake 3: Your emails are too long If the content of your email is too in-depth, especially for an introductory meeting, it will likely get skimmed and ignored. Many investment sales teams are tempted to include extensive details about their firm and their strategy, and while this may seem like the best way to cover all your bases, it can make the email too long and overwhelming, especially for an introduction. Solution: Less is more when it comes to first time outreach You can easily remedy this mistake by keeping things simple and to the point. Introduce yourself, your firm (at a high level) and ask for the meeting. Adding superfluous information and attachments too early on can be overwhelming and presumptuous. Instead, stick to a simple format, and send more information at a later date, once the relationship has been established. Mistake 4: You're not giving them a reason to respond We’ve talked about subject lines, now let’s get into the body of your email. If you’ve done the heavy lifting, introduced yourself and your strategy, what comes next is setting the meeting, which is where a lot of people struggle. We mentioned being specific in your subject lines, but also holds true for the body of your email. It’s important to finish strong by including a clear call to action. Without this, they have no reason to reply to your email. Solution: Use a clear CTA the recipient can’t ignore Tell the person on the other end exactly what you want, rather than simply asking if they have time to meet. Instead, include data and time that works for you, and see if it works for them. This gives the person something to respond to — either that time works for them or it doesn’t, but it prevents them from having to do the work on the front end, allowing them to confirm rather than set the meeting. Another thing that gets people reading and responding is giving additional context within the body of the email. This could be something topical within the industry that is relevant to their field or interests, but again it is important to be specific here rather than including details for the sake of it. Mistake 5: Your email is too forward and contains too many attachments Like we mentioned above, it can be tempting to include every detail about your firm in these initial emails, including every piece of marketing collateral. But this can be very forward, and many will not get looked at by the recipient. Solution: Save the attachments for a later date If you’re sending an initial, cold email, be thoughtful about what you’re sending. The goal of these initial emails is to lay the groundwork and establish a relationship. Don’t overwhelm the person on the other end by including countless attachments with marketing materials. When it comes to these initial emails, less is more. How to get started writing emails that will get answered The first step to drafting your perfect outreach email is to ensure that you have the right contact information. This is as easy as setting up a CRM for your team, and making it a part of your day to keep it as updated as possible. From there, you can test which subject lines work and which don’t, including details and relevant information to get your email opened. Finally, it’s important to be direct and up front about what you want from the email. Even small changes can make the difference between your email getting ignored and setting a meeting. Start with your contact details and subject lines and iterate from there.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': '5 Reasons Your Investment Sales Emails Aren’t Getting Read — And How to Fix It', 'content': "As the world slowly opens back up and more in-person meetings are being set, it’s important to know how to ask for those meetings.

# article_275_interview-dakota-and-prodromos-ceo-to-ceo-leadersh

{'title': 'Interview: Dakota and Prodromos CEO to CEO Leadership', 'introduction': 'During this interview, Gui Costin sits down with Jim Stagnitta and JC Glick, the co-founders of Prodromos. These two individuals are truly some of the most innovative leaders as it relates to coaching and coaching leadership. Prodromos is a coaching company that is all about leadership. They have worked with NFL teams and Fortune 500 Companies, among others, and have come to be true leaders in the industry. This interview will cover the background on both Jim Stagnitta, JC Glick, and Prodromos, as well as actionable takeaways you can use within your own firm. About JC Glick JC retired from 20 years of service in the army, primarily Special Operations, about seven years ago. He was fortunate enough to do 11 combat tours and served with the Rangers and a group called the Asymmetric Warfare Group. He left the army after leading their training and doctrine leadership school, resiliency school, and fitness school. What he was trying to do there was become more innovative in how they teach their leaders to lead, and how to get people to think about developing as opposed to meeting a standard. He did what all Special Operations guys do when they get out of the military, write a book. JC wrote a couple of books, but linked up with Jim through La Crosse and realized that there was more of an impact they could make together. Specifically in the sports world, but also in corporations in taking what Jim Stagnitta learned from all his years on the sports field combining that with his knowledge from the battlefield. It can be difficult to take what a sports coach engrains into you, and put it to work in a cubicle. More so, it can be difficult to take what an Army Ranger does and take action on it if you\'re working in a warehouse. This is exactly what JC and Jim try to help people do. About Jim Stagnitta Jim Stagnitta’s background is sports; he was a college coach for upwards of 30 years coaching in the professional league and continues to coach professionally now in the PLL. He has coached at the Division III level and the Division I level. He was an assistant here in Philadelphia at his elementary school, which is where he started at the University of Pennsylvania. He left college coaching about seven years ago, when his son went on to college to play himself. At that point, Jim had put a team together that would be able to work with corporations, organizations, and teams in all areas of development from the mind to the body, to the leadership piece. JC was his leadership head at that point. The start of Prodromos A few months into it the two of them had a conversation. JC told Jim he felt that he could take Jim’s 30 years of coaching experience and share that to help other people in ways that are sustainable. Jim was really drawn in from his experience as a young coach. He was maybe the youngest head coach in the country when he was first hired at Washington Lee. He was aware that he needed some development, and there was still a lot for him to learn, and other people could provide for his players. During that time he found very little of it to be sustainable, he found it to be a quick hit. If he found someone to show up for a day or two, they tended to assume they knew what their challenges were before they got there. So, Jim brought in consultants. Most of the programming that we did was templated and he found at the end of the day none of it was sustainable, and they weren\'t there when I really needed them in real-time. This is when JC and Jim focused on their approach: becoming part of a team, embedding yourself with an organization, embedding yourself with a team - which is what they did in their professional lives, JC as a Ranger and leader and Jim as a coach. Now, let’s get into the interview. CEO to CEO leadership discussion Who is Prodromos? GUI COSTIN: My name is Gui Costin, the founder of Dakota. We\'re a 60 person firm. We\'re in the investment business, where we raise money and then we have a software product. More importantly, with 60 people and we have over 30 sales people it requires a lot of coaching and training. Just give a short background on Prodromos, who you work with, what you do, but then let\'s talk about the problem that you saw in terms of other consultants coming in and where they basically fell down. Also, what you guys are trying to solve for. JIM STAGNITTA: Well, what we do is we have an approach. When people came in to work with me and my teams over those years, they didn\'t do the reconnaissance. They didn\'t put the time in to actually try to understand, observe, and collect the information they needed to truly understand where my challenges were and where my team\'s challenges were. That\'s really where we feel like we separate from a lot of people in our space. You know, first we\'re not academics. We\'ve actually led. We\'ve led in stressful situations and where there were high expectations. We\'ve had to develop cultures. Sometimes we\'ve done it really well, and sometimes we\'ve not done it so well. But we\'ve learned from all of those experiences. What our approach and our focus is, is to actually make or to enact change, to help and be involved in these teams as they evolve, to be their after hours. You know we don\'t have the approach when we talk with our partners - we\'re not attorneys, we don\'t charge you by the minute. Once we\'re engaged, we\'re there to help you and support you. Sometimes you just need someone to vent to, other times you may want some insights and thoughts. We tend to engage with our partners anywhere from a month, to six months, to a season. Evolving behavior JC GLICK: The questions matter. And you have to ask questions with only the intent to learn, right? That\'s it. And I think it\'s interesting because we might agree on the principle of the players now, but you have to ask the right questions. Because what the players know, and again, let\'s look at how they\'ve been conditioned their whole lives. Who are the captains of teams? The best players. Not the best leaders. That continues in the NFL and I\'m going to tell you that I actually called Jim the other day because we were talking to an NFL player. And he gave me an answer that was the best answer, I mean, we\'ve worked with the NFL for seven years now. We\'ve never gotten this answer. And I said, "What\'s your role as a leader on this team?" And without even thinking about he goes, "To make everyone around me better." We have never heard that in the NFL or the NBA since doing this. It\'s the best answer a leader can give. Now, I will tell you that is not what most teammates think that their leader needs to be. It\'s what they need, so you have to ask the right questions. You can\'t say, "Who do you think the best leader on the team is?" Because what they\'re probably going to tell you is who the best player is. What you really want to say is, "Hey, who do you think really takes care of you out there?" "Hey, who\'s always the last at practice?" "Hey, who\'s putting themselves in a position behind others?" So asking those questions. I agree, I think they know, but you got to ask the right questions. And what we constantly see with leaders is, they\'re asking questions and they\'re either not giving people the opportunity to answer them. Because they pause, and instead of just being comfortable with silence, we think we need to fill it. Or they\'re asking questions that they already know the answer to, which is again, look at the conditioning that we\'ve had, right? When have you ever been asked a question as a child that there wasn\'t an expectation of the answer? Prioritizing collaboration GUI COSTIN: Is there one core set of challenges that most organizations have that you both can go in and help solve for? Is there a kind of consistency? JC GLICK: As Jim was saying, a lot of consultants will come in and tell you everything you\'re doing wrong. We\'re not there to tell you everything you\'re doing wrong. We recognize that your workforce has been conditioned over your entire life to behave a certain way. This is the one thing that all of you face. For example, within every company leadership always complains about collaboration. We\'ve conditioned our children for 18 years  to not collaborate: keep your eyes on your own work, don\'t share your answers with anyone else. We don\'t grade people on group projects, we grade on the possibility of having one group project a year, but that\'s not real life. We\'ve conditioned people to be the way they are. You\'re not a bad leader or have a bad culture because your people don\'t collaborate. You just haven\'t spent the time to de-condition them to remove them from that. I believe a lot of it is understanding that good leaders or bad leaders, we\'re all facing the same kind of conditioning that\'s been bred into our workforce. What we have to do is teach them that there\'s another way to think. Obedience vs. Capacity GUI COSTIN: You\'re basically starting with the end in mind. I always say that if I\'m going to coach you on something, I\'m trying to put you at the highest level of professionalism. Meaning everything we\'re going to ask you to do, is in your best interest for your professional development. True coaching is trying to always make it about them. You\'re saying not just the physical equipment, but also the mental decision making. If you can do that and coach them right away from the beginning to develop them, they\'re going to become amazing soldiers, amazing salespeople, and amazing players. JIM STAGNITTA: Whether you\'re in the military, you\'re on a sports field, or you\'re in a business, one of the challenges we find that leaders face is that their people are obedient. By saying obedient, I mean they just do what they\'re told. Leaders tend to think that they have to have all the answers, when really what they should be doing is developing the capacity in our people, giving them the tools, resourcing them to be able to handle situations, and without having to come to the leader to get the answer. An example in sports is your coach can call a play and the defense or your enemy has a vote. They can come in, they could double-team the receiver, they could come out in a zone instead of playing man to man. If your team is obedient they\'re just going to go run the play that the coach gave them. If your team develops capacity, they\'re going to be able to handle the unknown. They\'re going to make the adjustment, they\'re going to make the decision. Whether it\'s a sales team, a sports team, or it\'s a military team in action you want to prepare your people to be able to give, empower, and resource them to be able to make decisions, develop, and in turn develop the next level of leaders coming up with them behind them. The question we ask leaders all the time is, what is the goal of leadership? The goal of leadership is to make the team better. GUI COSTIN: This can be so impactful to a team and organization. What I love about your coaching is you guys think so differently about leadership. Think about what you\'re just getting at with the term “different”. I coached my son\'s golf team for nine years, and I took it seriously, but I played college golf. Today in college golf if you ever watch it, which is mind numbing, it\'s a six hour round of golf, and the coaches literally play the game for the players. My son was 11 or 12 years old, and I made a commitment that I could only say two things to him, “Great swing” or, “Great shot”. That was Johnny Miller\'s line. One day as we\'re playing my son says, "Dad, what do you think, bump and run or flop shot?" I\'m like, "What do you think?" And he goes, "No, no, no, just tell me. Like what do you think?" I had to tell him when he’s in the situation, I won’t be there to tell him what to do, and he has to make the decision. I always took the philosophy of figuring it out. Give your team the capacity to figure it out. The strength of what you guys coach and what\'s such a difference is how you teach leaders to think like that. It\'s not intuitive. Because leaders do, like insecure parents, just want to make every decision for their kid. JC GLICK: We\'re so afraid of watching our children or our employees fail, because we think the consequences are so great. I was very fortunate to have a really great commander. I was going on my fifth rotation to combat and he asked me what my goals were. I said what I believed at the time, which was to bring all my guys back. He goes, "Stop. That is a stupid goal." And I was like, "Okay, I\'ve been told since I was a cadet that\'s what my job is." And he goes, "You\'re going to think you have everything right, and you\'re going to make a mistake at some point in combat. The cost and consequence of that mistake will be one of your Rangers lives. I\'m going to tell you that if your mistake is not born of negligence, meaning you should have known something or you should have read something that you didn\'t, it\'s okay." That completely changed how I looked at mistake making. Here\'s this guy who made it to four stars and commanded a very high level, and he just told me that it was okay if I made a mistake, even if the cost was a ranger\'s life. I later understood why that was important as a warrior, but it really made me look at the civilian world and leaders very differently. If this guy could say that I could lose a life, and if it wasn\'t born in negligence it\'s okay, then isn\'t it okay that my kid gets cut from a team every once in a while? Isn\'t it okay that they fail a test? Isn\'t it okay that they blow a sail? I mean can we really look at these things in context and say, alright, maybe we\'ve taken this zero failure idea a little too far. Trust matters most GUI COSTIN: When you look at Jeff Bezos, obviously the founder of Amazon, and look at his north star based on the core principles, they aren\'t like the off the shelf core principles, they are really well done. We\'ve done this at our organization. We have these concepts called Dakota-isms that guide everybody: walk the eight feet, sell apples to apple buyers, throw your hat over the wall, don\'t go cowboy. When I think of working with a consulting firm on leadership, what would be some of the tactical key takeaways that you leave an organization with? Or on a continuous basis that you establish for them so they can follow that? JIM STAGNITTA: Sure - our tagline says it all, people over everything. We believe that as a leader if your people trust you and believe you have their best interest in mind, they will do anything for you. Creating that culture and environment can be really uncomfortable for leaders. Leaders give up ownership and allow their people to make decisions, and sometimes fail and learn from those decisions. However, we believe that when leaders take on and embrace that approach, there\'s sustainability and consistency in the outcomes for that company. We believe that leaders have certain traits. One of these that we help develop is curiosity so the leader is not just coming from their own personal perspective, because that\'s their own story in their head. This usually leads to the worst case scenario. Sometimes my children do some things and I shake my head. I go, "Why would you do something like that?" Then when I truly ask, "Hey, tell me why you did that." There\'s some real merit in why they made that decision. We have to be willing to do that with our people, and we have to empower our people and give them ownership. We don\'t look for change, we look for evolution. People don\'t like change, but they will evolve. When you\'re working with us, we\'re going to challenge you. That\'s what we\'re there for. It can often be uncomfortable for the leader to give up some power and give up some ownership to allow their people to make mistakes. GUI COSTIN: Let\'s dig a little deeper on that concept of curiosity. Going back to Jeff Bezos, he said you have to go 6 layers deep within the organization. If you think about institutional knowledge within a company, if you\'re a leader and you\'re not asking questions to that person who probably has the answers, you\'ve just never asked that they feel uncomfortable speaking up. You have to dig right in order to get to the answers. Can you talk about that? Because to me, if you\'re talking about one key distinction of working with you guys, you have to get the leaders curious to ask the questions. JIM STAGNITTA: There\'s two parts of it. They have to be authentic in their curiosity. They have to have humility. They have to actually be willing to listen to understand the problem, not just listen for the sake of listening. When you do that and you are authentic, your people will start to give you answers. We talk about it all the time. If you sit-in a room full of people, whether it\'s a sports team or whether it\'s a corporation and/or a sales team, and you ask them a question, “What happens if the person that you\'re trying to sell to gives you this answer right away?” What you\'re going to get out of 90% of the people in that room is something negative. When you do just a little test of probable vs. possible, this is only probable, but this is possible, you find out that the percentage to make that a positive is much higher. If you\'re not curious you\'re only coming from one perspective. That\'s your own, and it\'s just to stitch your own story. Getting people to understand and ask questions at every level. Getting them to ask questions, it also helps you to understand how people learn, how they develop, how they think. GUI COSTIN: This is so interesting because I have two kids that play college lacrosse, obviously Jim you did. You coached college lacrosse for 30 years. But there was always this line from either John Nostrant or Paul O\'Grady, and they always talked about how you select captains. And they would always say the players know. You ask the players and they know who the best leaders are. Transformational vs. Transactional GUI COSTIN: Coming to the end, I do want to talk about sales - because it\'s one of my favorite topics. Sales are all shades of gray. Working with sales teams can be invaluable for the sales leadership. I also believe people feel the most threatened when someone tries to change their sales process. However, if they have this willingness to be a lifelong learner and get better, the results can be exponential. So if you\'re a sales leader, walk me through why you consider working with other groups within an organization vs. just the sales leadership team or sales, why it\'s so difficult, and then what you believe you can do to help sales leaders. JIM STAGNITTA: I think a lot of times salespeople are like individual sports guys. They rely on themselves and produce for themselves. When you have an organization and you have a culture, it only takes a few people within that culture to take it down. When you have a culture and then you have a sales team that is based on individual production and reaching certain goals and receiving certain honors, it\'s contrary to the rest of the culture in the organization. This is another one that’s really a challenge. We haven’t been successful 100% of time time. Sometimes it\'s hard to break that. That comes from the top. If the leader and the CEO are not willing to look at sales as something that is more transformational in relationship than transactional, we\'re going to fail. That challenge becomes, getting the sales team and CEO to understand that the transformational aspect of sales should trump the transactional piece of sales, if that makes sense. GUI COSTIN: Really what you\'re getting at first off with sales, is it has to come from the top, and it\'s difficult. In our pre-discussion we were talking about how tough it is to unpack something that\'s already existing within a sales organization. I encourage you as a sales leader to have these worthwhile conversations. Because the smallest little changes can have such a big impact. I think every situation is going to be a little bit different, but getting in and analyzing what\'s really going on and having a consulting group like yourselves to facilitate this is really worth its weight in gold. JIM STAGNITTA: I mean, here\'s a key piece that\'s really uncomfortable, right? It\'s that capability vs. capacity piece. Capability is learned, while capability could be a script that you recite on a sales call. When there\'s some pushback, you need capacity and the ability to adjust in real-time. That\'s where resilience comes in, right? Real-time challenges. If you just continue to follow the script and push in this direction, you could be going completely off where your prospect needs you to be. We’ll often run into very capability-based sales teams where we try to instill the idea of capacity and being able to think on your feet and make adjustments - actually lead the client and be able to provide for them what they truly need, not what you think they need. GUI COSTIN: Right, value. So JC, any comments just as we\'re talking about sales teams in your approach? JC GLICK: I think that what we do with sales teams, and again, I certainly don\'t consider myself a sales person. So for me, it\'s really about talking to the sales leaders about why they do certain things and what the benefit they think of that is, especially if it\'s what I think is contrary to what could get them to the next level. We know at the base of human requirements is a need for connection. It\'s at the root of everything we do, we have to have this connection. Everybody gets this wrong and they think, “Oh, I need purpose”. People need purpose and connection. Once they find connection, then they\'ll find purpose. Sometimes it\'s good and sometimes it\'s bad. But if we start to look at something that separates people such as, “Hey, here\'s our number one salesman or number two salesman or number three salesman.” Hey, that\'s great. You\'ve just put a whole lot of pressure on the number one salesperson. The number five salesperson feels like a turd. Do you think that that\'s what\'s going to motivate them? For some it will, about a third. If you said to your team, “I don\'t want one great salesman and four mediocre salespeople. I would rather have five good salespeople.” The question is, how do we connect these people in a way that\'s meaningful, so they can all be successful and lift each other up as they climb? It\'s not a threat, it\'s actually what we want them to do. So asking the questions like, "Okay, so what would happen if we did it this way?"

These two individuals are truly some of the most innovative leaders as it relates to coaching and coaching leadership. Prodromos is a coaching company that is all about leadership. They have worked with NFL teams and Fortune 500 Companies, among others, and have come to be true leaders in the industry. This interview will cover the background on both Jim Stagnitta, JC Glick, and Prodromos, as well as actionable takeaways you can use within your own firm. About JC Glick JC retired from 20 years of service in the army, primarily Special Operations, about seven years ago. He was fortunate enough to do 11 combat tours and served with the Rangers and a group called the Asymmetric Warfare Group. He left the army after leading their training and doctrine leadership school, resiliency school, and fitness school. What he was trying to do there was become more innovative in how they teach their leaders to lead, and how to get people to think about developing as opposed to meeting a standard. He did what all Special Operations guys do when they get out of the military, write a book. JC wrote a couple of books, but linked up with Jim through La Crosse and realized that there was more of an impact they could make together. Specifically in the sports world, but also in corporations in taking what Jim Stagnitta learned from all his years on the sports field combining that with his knowledge from the battlefield. It can be difficult to take what a sports coach engrains into you, and put it to work in a cubicle. More so, it can be difficult to take what an Army Ranger does and take action on it if you\'re working in a warehouse. This is exactly what JC and Jim try to help people do. About Jim Stagnitta Jim Stagnitta’s background is sports; he was a college coach for upwards of 30 years coaching in the professional league and continues to coach professionally now in the PLL. He has coached at the Division III level and the Division I level. He was an assistant here in Philadelphia at his elementary school, which is where he started at the University of Pennsylvania. He left college coaching about seven years ago, when his son went on to college to play himself. At that point, Jim had put a team together that would be able to work with corporations, organizations, and teams in all areas of development from the mind to the body, to the leadership piece. JC was his leadership head at that point. The start of Prodromos A few months into it the two of them had a conversation. JC told Jim he felt that he could take Jim’s 30 years of coaching experience and share that to help other people in ways that are sustainable. Jim was really drawn in from his experience as a young coach. He was maybe the youngest head coach in the country when he was first hired at Washington Lee. He was aware that he needed some development, and there was still a lot for him to learn, and other people could provide for his players. During that time he found very little of it to be sustainable, he found it to be a quick hit. If he found someone to show up for a day or two, they tended to assume they knew what their challenges were before they got there. So, Jim brought in consultants. Most of the programming that we did was templated and he found at the end of the day none of it was sustainable, and they weren\'t there when I really needed them in real-time. This is when JC and Jim focused on their approach: becoming part of a team, embedding yourself with an organization, embedding yourself with a team - which is what they did in their professional lives, JC as a Ranger and leader and Jim as a coach. Now, let’s get into the interview. CEO to CEO leadership discussion Who is Prodromos? GUI COSTIN: My name is Gui Costin, the founder of Dakota. We\'re a 60 person firm. We\'re in the investment business, where we raise money and then we have a software product. More importantly, with 60 people and we have over 30 sales people it requires a lot of coaching and training. Just give a short background on Prodromos, who you work with, what you do, but then let\'s talk about the problem that you saw in terms of other consultants coming in and where they basically fell down. Also, what you guys are trying to solve for. JIM STAGNITTA: Well, what we do is we have an approach. When people came in to work with me and my teams over those years, they didn\'t do the reconnaissance. They didn\'t put the time in to actually try to understand, observe, and collect the information they needed to truly understand where my challenges were and where my team\'s challenges were. That\'s really where we feel like we separate from a lot of people in our space. You know, first we\'re not academics. We\'ve actually led. We\'ve led in stressful situations and where there were high expectations. We\'ve had to develop cultures. Sometimes we\'ve done it really well, and sometimes we\'ve not done it so well. But we\'ve learned from all of those experiences. What our approach and our focus is, is to actually make or to enact change, to help and be involved in these teams as they evolve, to be their after hours. You know we don\'t have the approach when we talk with our partners - we\'re not attorneys, we don\'t charge you by the minute. Once we\'re engaged, we\'re there to help you and support you. Sometimes you just need someone to vent to, other times you may want some insights and thoughts. We tend to engage with our partners anywhere from a month, to six months, to a season. Evolving behavior JC GLICK: The questions matter. And you have to ask questions with only the intent to learn, right? That\'s it. And I think it\'s interesting because we might agree on the principle of the players now, but you have to ask the right questions. Because what the players know, and again, let\'s look at how they\'ve been conditioned their whole lives. Who are the captains of teams? The best players. Not the best leaders. That continues in the NFL and I\'m going to tell you that I actually called Jim the other day because we were talking to an NFL player. And he gave me an answer that was the best answer, I mean, we\'ve worked with the NFL for seven years now. We\'ve never gotten this answer. And I said, "What\'s your role as a leader on this team?" And without even thinking about he goes, "To make everyone around me better." We have never heard that in the NFL or the NBA since doing this. It\'s the best answer a leader can give. Now, I will tell you that is not what most teammates think that their leader needs to be. It\'s what they need, so you have to ask the right questions. You can\'t say, "Who do you think the best leader on the team is?" Because what they\'re probably going to tell you is who the best player is. What you really want to say is, "Hey, who do you think really takes care of you out there?" "Hey, who\'s always the last at practice?" "Hey, who\'s putting themselves in a position behind others?" So asking those questions. I agree, I think they know, but you got to ask the right questions. And what we constantly see with leaders is, they\'re asking questions and they\'re either not giving people the opportunity to answer them. Because they pause, and instead of just being comfortable with silence, we think we need to fill it. Or they\'re asking questions that they already know the answer to, which is again, look at the conditioning that we\'ve had, right? When have you ever been asked a question as a child that there wasn\'t an expectation of the answer? Prioritizing collaboration GUI COSTIN: Is there one core set of challenges that most organizations have that you both can go in and help solve for? Is there a kind of consistency? JC GLICK: As Jim was saying, a lot of consultants will come in and tell you everything you\'re doing wrong. We\'re not there to tell you everything you\'re doing wrong. We recognize that your workforce has been conditioned over your entire life to behave a certain way. This is the one thing that all of you face. For example, within every company leadership always complains about collaboration. We\'ve conditioned our children for 18 years  to not collaborate: keep your eyes on your own work, don\'t share your answers with anyone else. We don\'t grade people on group projects, we grade on the possibility of having one group project a year, but that\'s not real life. We\'ve conditioned people to be the way they are. You\'re not a bad leader or have a bad culture because your people don\'t collaborate. You just haven\'t spent the time to de-condition them to remove them from that. I believe a lot of it is understanding that good leaders or bad leaders, we\'re all facing the same kind of conditioning that\'s been bred into our workforce. What we have to do is teach them that there\'s another way to think. Obedience vs. Capacity GUI COSTIN: You\'re basically starting with the end in mind. I always say that if I\'m going to coach you on something, I\'m trying to put you at the highest level of professionalism. Meaning everything we\'re going to ask you to do, is in your best interest for your professional development. True coaching is trying to always make it about them. You\'re saying not just the physical equipment, but also the mental decision making. If you can do that and coach them right away from the beginning to develop them, they\'re going to become amazing soldiers, amazing salespeople, and amazing players. JIM STAGNITTA: Whether you\'re in the military, you\'re on a sports field, or you\'re in a business, one of the challenges we find that leaders face is that their people are obedient. By saying obedient, I mean they just do what they\'re told. Leaders tend to think that they have to have all the answers, when really what they should be doing is developing the capacity in our people, giving them the tools, resourcing them to be able to handle situations, and without having to come to the leader to get the answer. An example in sports is your coach can call a play and the defense or your enemy has a vote. They can come in, they could double-team the receiver, they could come out in a zone instead of playing man to man. If your team is obedient they\'re just going to go run the play that the coach gave them. If your team develops capacity, they\'re going to be able to handle the unknown. They\'re going to make the adjustment, they\'re going to make the decision. Whether it\'s a sales team, a sports team, or it\'s a military team in action you want to prepare your people to be able to give, empower, and resource them to be able to make decisions, develop, and in turn develop the next level of leaders coming up with them behind them. The question we ask leaders all the time is, what is the goal of leadership? The goal of leadership is to make the team better. GUI COSTIN: This can be so impactful to a team and organization. What I love about your coaching is you guys think so differently about leadership. Think about what you\'re just getting at with the term “different”. I coached my son\'s golf team for nine years, and I took it seriously, but I played college golf. Today in college golf if you ever watch it, which is mind numbing, it\'s a six hour round of golf, and the coaches literally play the game for the players. My son was 11 or 12 years old, and I made a commitment that I could only say two things to him, “Great swing” or, “Great shot”. That was Johnny Miller\'s line. One day as we\'re playing my son says, "Dad, what do you think, bump and run or flop shot?" I\'m like, "What do you think?" And he goes, "No, no, no, just tell me. Like what do you think?" I had to tell him when he’s in the situation, I won’t be there to tell him what to do, and he has to make the decision. I always took the philosophy of figuring it out. Give your team the capacity to figure it out. The strength of what you guys coach and what\'s such a difference is how you teach leaders to think like that. It\'s not intuitive. Because leaders do, like insecure parents, just want to make every decision for their kid. JC GLICK: We\'re so afraid of watching our children or our employees fail, because we think the consequences are so great. I was very fortunate to have a really great commander. I was going on my fifth rotation to combat and he asked me what my goals were. I said what I believed at the time, which was to bring all my guys back. He goes, "Stop. That is a stupid goal." And I was like, "Okay, I\'ve been told since I was a cadet that\'s what my job is." And he goes, "You\'re going to think you have everything right, and you\'re going to make a mistake at some point in combat. The cost and consequence of that mistake will be one of your Rangers lives. I\'m going to tell you that if your mistake is not born of negligence, meaning you should have known something or you should have read something that you didn\'t, it\'s okay." That completely changed how I looked at mistake making. Here\'s this guy who made it to four stars and commanded a very high level, and he just told me that it was okay if I made a mistake, even if the cost was a ranger\'s life. I later understood why that was important as a warrior, but it really made me look at the civilian world and leaders very differently. If this guy could say that I could lose a life, and if it wasn\'t born in negligence it\'s okay, then isn\'t it okay that my kid gets cut from a team every once in a while? Isn\'t it okay that they fail a test? Isn\'t it okay that they blow a sail? I mean can we really look at these things in context and say, alright, maybe we\'ve taken this zero failure idea a little too far. Trust matters most GUI COSTIN: When you look at Jeff Bezos, obviously the founder of Amazon, and look at his north star based on the core principles, they aren\'t like the off the shelf core principles, they are really well done. We\'ve done this at our organization. We have these concepts called Dakota-isms that guide everybody: walk the eight feet, sell apples to apple buyers, throw your hat over the wall, don\'t go cowboy. When I think of working with a consulting firm on leadership, what would be some of the tactical key takeaways that you leave an organization with? Or on a continuous basis that you establish for them so they can follow that? JIM STAGNITTA: Sure - our tagline says it all, people over everything. We believe that as a leader if your people trust you and believe you have their best interest in mind, they will do anything for you. Creating that culture and environment can be really uncomfortable for leaders. Leaders give up ownership and allow their people to make decisions, and sometimes fail and learn from those decisions. However, we believe that when leaders take on and embrace that approach, there\'s sustainability and consistency in the outcomes for that company. We believe that leaders have certain traits. One of these that we help develop is curiosity so the leader is not just coming from their own personal perspective, because that\'s their own story in their head. This usually leads to the worst case scenario. Sometimes my children do some things and I shake my head. I go, "Why would you do something like that?" Then when I truly ask, "Hey, tell me why you did that." There\'s some real merit in why they made that decision. We have to be willing to do that with our people, and we have to empower our people and give them ownership. We don\'t look for change, we look for evolution. People don\'t like change, but they will evolve. When you\'re working with us, we\'re going to challenge you. That\'s what we\'re there for. It can often be uncomfortable for the leader to give up some power and give up some ownership to allow their people to make mistakes. GUI COSTIN: Let\'s dig a little deeper on that concept of curiosity. Going back to Jeff Bezos, he said you have to go 6 layers deep within the organization.

# article_046_november-2024-financial-advisor-moves-and-ria-acqu

{'title': 'November 2024 Financial Advisor Moves and RIA Acquisitions', 'introduction': 'Last month’s M&A activity in the RIA space proved hard to beat, after October broke records not only for transaction volume – 37 by Dakota’s count, surpassing the previous high of 31 deals in January 2021 – but also by magnitude, following the closing of LPL Financial’s acquisition of $100B Atria Wealth Partners. In contrast, November was a quieter month, with Dakota tracking 17 announced M&A deals involving approximately $25.6B in client assets. That’s just 10% of the $255B in client AUM acquired in RIA deals in October, inclusive of the LPL-Atria completion. Still, there were some notable deals in the month, with Focus Financial’s The Colony Group integrating $6.1B in AUM from its merger with sister company GYL Financial Synergies and CAPTRUST’s acquisition of $5B RIA Boston Financial Management. Another big deal could be in the offing as well, with $9B Los Angeles RIA Churchill Management Group reportedly on the market. On the RIA investments side, November was also quieter than October, with just three confirmed US minority stake deals, though again, another notable deal could materialize in the near future, with $4.8B RIA Kingsview Partners reportedly tapping Republic Capital Group to assist it with the sale of a minority stake. Serial investor Merchant Investment Management reportedly took a stake in a $1.8B FiNet shop of Wells Fargo’s, though with Wells now apparently requiring pre-approval for outside investment in FiNet practices, it will be interesting to see what effect that has on the volume of similar deals in the future. Merchant also scored a cross-border investment during the month, reportedly staking $713M Canadian advisor SPM Financial. Meanwhile, November saw an uptick in independent advisor moves, with Dakota tracking approximately 59 moves by individual advisors or advisor teams, up from around 43 in October. LPL led recruitment activity for the third month in a row with it or its affiliated advisors adding eight teams representing over $2B in collective client assets. Raymond James again closely followed in terms of recruitment frequency, with six new additions representing $2.76B in combined client assets. In terms of client assets recruited, Bank of America stood out by nabbing a $7B private advisor duo from Citi Private Bank, though perhaps most notable in the month was Prudential Advisors completing the integration of its retail broker-dealer and RIA services with LPL. First announced in August 2023, the tie-up represents 2,800 advisors and $60B in client assets that are now part of the LPL network. Other noteworthy developments include the launch of two new RIAs: Indivisible Partners by former Merrill Lynch wealth management head John Thiel, and THECE Wealth Management by former Corient Capital Partners co-founder Jon Tenney. Mercer Capital and Allworth Financial did deals to expand the tax services side of their business, and there were a host of advisor-recruitment-related people moves in the month as well. Read on for a full roundup of the month’s RIA Deals, Advisor Moves, and Other News covered by Dakota: RIA Deals Stifel to Buy Portion of B. Riley Wealth Management Biz for up to $35M B. Riley Financial will sell part of its wealth management business to Stifel for $27M to $35M, with 40 to 50 advisors managing $3.5B to $4.5B in assets transitioning to Stifel in early 2025.

In contrast, November was a quieter month, with Dakota tracking 17 announced M&A deals involving approximately $25.6B in client assets. That’s just 10% of the $255B in client AUM acquired in RIA deals in October, inclusive of the LPL-Atria completion. Still, there were some notable deals in the month, with Focus Financial’s The Colony Group integrating $6.1B in AUM from its merger with sister company GYL Financial Synergies and CAPTRUST’s acquisition of $5B RIA Boston Financial Management. Another big deal could be in the offing as well, with $9B Los Angeles RIA Churchill Management Group reportedly on the market. On the RIA investments side, November was also quieter than October, with just three confirmed US minority stake deals, though again, another notable deal could materialize in the near future, with $4.8B RIA Kingsview Partners reportedly tapping Republic Capital Group to assist it with the sale of a minority stake. Serial investor Merchant Investment Management reportedly took a stake in a $1.8B FiNet shop of Wells Fargo’s, though with Wells now apparently requiring pre-approval for outside investment in FiNet practices, it will be interesting to see what effect that has on the volume of similar deals in the future. Merchant also scored a cross-border investment during the month, reportedly staking $713M Canadian advisor SPM Financial. Meanwhile, November saw an uptick in independent advisor moves, with Dakota tracking approximately 59 moves by individual advisors or advisor teams, up from around 43 in October. LPL led recruitment activity for the third month in a row with it or its affiliated advisors adding eight teams representing over $2B in collective client assets. Raymond James again closely followed in terms of recruitment frequency, with six new additions representing $2.76B in combined client assets. In terms of client assets recruited, Bank of America stood out by nabbing a $7B private advisor duo from Citi Private Bank, though perhaps most notable in the month was Prudential Advisors completing the integration of its retail broker-dealer and RIA services with LPL. First announced in August 2023, the tie-up represents 2,800 advisors and $60B in client assets that are now part of the LPL network. Other noteworthy developments include the launch of two new RIAs: Indivisible Partners by former Merrill Lynch wealth management head John Thiel, and THECE Wealth Management by former Corient Capital Partners co-founder Jon Tenney. Mercer Capital and Allworth Financial did deals to expand the tax services side of their business, and there were a host of advisor-recruitment-related people moves in the month as well. Read on for a full roundup of the month’s RIA Deals, Advisor Moves, and Other News covered by Dakota: RIA Deals Stifel to Buy Portion of B. Riley Wealth Management Biz for up to $35M B. Riley Financial will sell part of its wealth management business to Stifel for $27M to $35M, with 40 to 50 advisors managing $3.5B to $4.5B in assets transitioning to Stifel in early 2025.

{'title': 'A Guide to Video for Investment Firms', 'introduction': "If you’re struggling to build relationships and get your strategy in front of the right people without hours of Zoom calls and meetings, you’re not alone. As we approach the one year mark of life in a new reality, the majority of the investment world is starting to feel the Zoom fatigue. While we’ve all adapted to a new way of doing business and raising capital, it hasn't always been easy. Finding the right people to call and then spending hours doing introductory meetings can take its toll, and it definitely takes up a lot of time. But, there is a way around all of those introductory calls. Incorporating personalized videos into your introduction strategy helps lay the groundwork of the relationship you’re building with an allocator, and eliminates the back and forth phone calls that can take hours out of your day. Look at it this way: most of the meetings investment sales professionals are having are first time meetings. If you can be better prepared for a first time meeting, it makes better use of everyone’s time, especially if an allocator knows the details of an account and strategy before any meetings are held. You can use short, two to three minute videos to go over the same things you would cover at an in-person meeting. Give the analyst a brief overview, including your firm’s description, philosophy, an introduction to your team, and of course, an overview of your strategy. We’ve been told time and again that analysts love being able to learn about a firm and their expectations and strategies prior to engaging in conversation with that portfolio manager. And, with the launch of Dakota Studios just around the corner, we wanted to share some of our video expertise, so that you can make the best, most informative videos possible. In this article, we’ll break down the five key videos your team should film and send to allocators prior to meeting with them. By the end of this article, you’ll be able to make the best first impression videos possible, and shorten the time it takes to get your strategy in front of the right people. Video #1: Introduce your firm This video should let the analyst know exactly who they’re talking to. Use this first video to introduce your firm, the strategy, and your philosophy. The goal of the video is to be transparent, bringing as much information to the table as possible so that when you do have that conversation with an analyst and the Portfolio Manager, it can be more productive because you’ve already hit on the key elements. Meetings can cover the key questions, because key elements of the story have been covered in videos. There are a few key things to include in this video: The name of your firm When it was founded Where you’re located The history of the firm, including how it’s evolved over the years to current state The ownership structure: outline who the key people within the organization are, how they’re incentivized, what motivates them, etc. Is there a clear path to partnership? These are all things Analysts want to hear about up front. Your overall philosophy: what are the guiding principles of the firm that define who you are and what you do? These should start with “we believe,” and should explain the value you’re bringing to potential investors. Video #2: Introduce the team The second video you send to an allocator should give them a sense of the team dynamic within your firm, covering the names and roles of the key players, as well as anyone the allocator might be working with in the future. Some key details to include in this video: The number of people on the team. You can break them down by role and cover their tenure with the firm, who they’re supported by, and the numbers of analysts and how they’re structured. The resources at the firm that exist to support the strategies. An allocator will want to know up front that things won’t fall through the cracks, and that a level of support exists to keep everything running as smoothly as possible. Video #3: Provide an overview of your strategy The third video in your series should contain a detailed overview of the strategy you’re presenting. Too often, we’ve seen investment managers dive into things too early, getting into the weeds without first setting the stage and centering the conversation so that the allocators and analysts understand exactly what they’re there to talk about. To eliminate any confusion, the third video should include details such as: Key information about the strategy: how it’s accessed, and how people can invest in it. This allows the analyst to start thinking about how your particular strategy will fit with others in their portfolio. Key differences of your strategy: Discuss what the differences are between each vehicle, and how they fit together. The capacity: This is dependent on different asset classes, but be sure to be transparent about capacity, and explain where you are today as far as assets. You can also talk about the history of assets in the strategy, and the trends and struggles you’ve experienced with it, as well as how you could be doing better. The more transparent you can be about this up front, the better. Your underlying client base. Describe your clients and who they are, and if they are on the institutional side, or service through intermediary channels. Video #4: Explain the investment process and portfolio construction This next video should give the allocator an idea of what sets your firm apart from others that would manage a similar strategy. Be sure to tell them what makes your firm unique by covering things such as: Your process: how do you manage your strategy? What are you most focused on? There are no right or wrong answers, but you should be striving to connect with the person on the other end watching the video. The firm’s mode of idea generation: what does your strategy look like? What is that pool of investable assets for you to be drawing from? Where are ideas being generated? Use this video to five into the key details of the process. Video #5: Give an overview of portfolio characteristics The fifth and final video we recommend sending should level-set the allocator’s expectations. Set them up for success by covering things such as: The risk and return profile of your strategy. Talk about your objective: what are you trying to achieve in terms of absolute or relative returns? Covering this in a video helps the key allocator and analyst figure out how they can best use your strategy. An honest overview of performance expectations, especially within different market environments. Return expectations on a risk basis: what are your expectations over a certain period of time? What are some of the ways you’re managing risk? Make an impression: start shooting We’ve found that the best way forward is to just start shooting. After all, no one knows your firm better than you. With these tips in mind, you’ll be able to lay the foundation with key allocators and analysts, so that when it comes time to meet, you can get right into the most important aspects of your strategy without wasting time.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'A Guide to Video for Investment Firms', 'content': "If you’re struggling to build relationships and get your strategy in front of the right people without hours of Zoom calls and meetings, you’re not alone. As we approach the one year mark of life in a new reality, the majority of the investment world is starting to feel the Zoom fatigue. While we’ve all adapted to a new way of doing business and raising capital, it hasn't always been easy. Finding the right people to call and then spending hours doing introductory meetings can take its toll, and it definitely takes up a lot of time. But, there is a way around all of those introductory calls. Incorporating personalized videos into your introduction strategy helps lay the groundwork of the relationship you’re building with an allocator, and eliminates the back and forth phone calls that can take hours out of your day. Look at it this way: most of the meetings investment sales professionals are having are first time meetings. If you can be better prepared for a first time meeting, it makes better use of everyone’s time, especially if an allocator knows the details of an account and strategy before any meetings are held. You can use short, two to three minute videos to go over the same things you would cover at an in-person meeting. Give the analyst a brief overview, including your firm’s description, philosophy, an introduction to your team, and of course, an overview of your strategy. We’ve been told time and again that analysts love being able to learn about a firm and their expectations and strategies prior to engaging in conversation with that portfolio manager. And, with the launch of Dakota Studios just around the corner, we wanted to share some of our video expertise, so that you can make the best, most informative videos possible. In this article, we’ll break down the five key videos your team should film and send to allocators prior to meeting with them. By the end of this article, you’ll be able to make the best first impression videos possible, and shorten the time it takes to get your strategy in front of the right people. Video #1: Introduce your firm This video should let the analyst know exactly who they’re talking to. Use this first video to introduce your firm, the strategy, and your philosophy. The goal of the video is to be transparent, bringing as much information to the table as possible so that when you do have that conversation with an analyst and the Portfolio Manager, it can be more productive because you’ve already hit on the key elements. Meetings can cover the key questions, because key elements of the story have been covered in videos. There are a few key things to include in this video: The name of your firm When it was founded Where you’re located The history of the firm, including how it’s evolved over the years to current state The ownership structure: outline who the key people within the organization are, how they’re incentivized, what motivates them, etc. Is there a clear path to partnership? These are all things Analysts want to hear about up front. Your overall philosophy: what are the guiding principles of the firm that define who you are and what you do? These should start with “we believe,” and should explain the value you’re bringing to potential investors. Video #2: Introduce the team The second video you send to an allocator should give them a sense of the team dynamic within your firm, covering the names and roles of the key players, as well as anyone the allocator might be working with in the future. Some key details to include in this video: The number of people on the team. You can break them down by role and cover their tenure with the firm, who they’re supported by, and the numbers of analysts and how they’re structured. The resources at the firm that exist to support the strategies. An allocator will want to know up front that things won’t fall through the cracks, and that a level of support exists to keep everything running as smoothly as possible. Video #3: Provide an overview of your strategy The third video in your series should contain a detailed overview of the strategy you’re presenting. Too often, we’ve seen investment managers dive into things too early, getting into the weeds without first setting the stage and centering the conversation so that the allocators and analysts understand exactly what they’re there to talk about. To eliminate any confusion, the third video should include details such as: Key information about the strategy: how it’s accessed, and how people can invest in it. This allows the analyst to start thinking about how your particular strategy will fit with others in their portfolio. Key differences of your strategy: Discuss what the differences are between each vehicle, and how they fit together. The capacity: This is dependent on different asset classes, but be sure to be transparent about capacity, and explain where you are today as far as assets. You can also talk about the history of assets in the strategy, and the trends and struggles you’ve experienced with it, as well as how you could be doing better. The more transparent you can be about this up front, the better. Your underlying client base. Describe your clients and who they are, and if they are on the institutional side, or service through intermediary channels. Video #4: Explain the investment process and portfolio construction This next video should give the allocator an idea of what sets your firm apart from others that would manage a similar strategy. Be sure to tell them what makes your firm unique by covering things such as: Your process: how do you manage your strategy? What are you most focused on? There are no right or wrong answers, but you should be striving to connect with the person on the other end watching the video. The firm’s mode of idea generation: what does your strategy look like? What is that pool of investable assets for you to be drawing from? Where are ideas being generated? Use this video to five into the key details of the process.

# article_212_how-to-leverage-your-crm-to-10x-productivity

{'title': 'How to Leverage Your CRM to 10x Productivity', 'introduction': "It’s been reported that 43% of CRM users only use less than half the features of their CRM system. Lack of CRM adoption costs businesses millions of dollars a year, therefore making it your most underutilized asset. In the competitive world of sales, productivity isn't just a goal. It's the currency that can set a salesperson apart from the rest. Yet, the conversation often circles around the adoption of a Customer Relationship Management (CRM) platform. However, it's time to debunk this myth and focus on what truly matters: leveraging CRM to enhance productivity. For too long, the emphasis has been placed on the mere adoption of CRM systems. Companies invest substantial resources into these platforms, but without proper integration into the daily workflow of sales teams, they are little more than digital paperweights. Adoption, in the absence of effective utilization, is not a victory. In this article, we won’t be convincing you to purchase a CRM; rather, we’re telling you it’s vital in order to minimize your time spent on meaningless administrative tasks. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of how properly using your CRM will 10x your productivity, and allow your team to focus on what matters most: setting up meetings and making the right calls. 10x Your Sales Team’s Productivity The key takeaway is that CRM systems are not the end goal; they are a means to an end. The ultimate objective is to use a CRM to its fullest potential to directly benefit the sales team. If your CRM isn't saving time for your salespeople, if it isn't making their job easier, and if it isn't boosting their productivity, then its implementation is a missed opportunity. In today's fast-paced and increasingly data-driven sales environment, not using a CRM is akin to leaving money on the table. It's a missed opportunity for a number of reasons, and here’s three why: Data Disorganization Without a CRM, customer data can become scattered across emails, notes, spreadsheets, or even post-it notes. This disorganization means that valuable insights and information can be lost and overlooked. A CRM organizes all information in one place, making it easily accessible and actionable. Inefficient Communication Sales teams not utilizing CRMs often struggle to maintain consistent communication, both internally and with customers. There’s no shared platform to track interactions, which can lead to mixed messages or duplicated efforts. CRMs streamline communication and ensure that everyone has the most up-to-date information. Lost Sales Opportunities When customer information is not centralized, opportunities for cross-selling, upselling, or even timely follow-ups can be missed. A CRM helps in identifying these opportunities by analyzing customer data and past purchases, and it prompts salespeople when an opportunity arises. New call-to-action Reduce Time and Maximize Efficiency A well-utilized CRM system is a treasure trove of efficiency. With instant access to customer data, you can easily understand client needs and identify the right moments for engagement. When a salesperson knows exactly who to reach out to and when, they spend less time sifting through data and more time in meaningful interactions with clients. This is what will ultimately drive revenue and growth for your team. Here's what CRM adoption should really look like for salespeople: Efficiency in Information Retrieval: No more digging through files or old emails. CRM brings a one-stop solution to keep all client information accessible. Targeted Outreach: With CRM analytics, sales teams can predict and identify the most promising leads, ensuring their efforts are not just shotgun blasts in the dark. Automating Tedious Tasks: From scheduling follow-ups to managing contacts, CRMs can take over the mundane, allowing salespeople to focus on closing deals. Streamlined Communication: By tracking all customer interactions, sales teams can deliver personalized experiences, fostering better relationships and trust. The more time sales teams can devote to actively setting up and conducting meetings, the more they’ll gain. Every minute spent on non-sales activities is a minute lost from what truly adds to the bottom line. If you're a sales leader, it's imperative to communicate and demonstrate the value of CRM in terms that resonate with your team's daily experiences. It's not just about learning a new system; it's about integrating a tool that will make their professional lives more profitable and less burdensome. A CRM holds the key to unlocking the potential of your sales team, but only if leveraged correctly. It's not simply about adoption; it's about integration and using the system to its full advantage. By focusing on productivity and making CRM an indispensable part of your sales strategy, you're not just keeping up with the times; you're setting the pace for success.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'How to Leverage Your CRM to 10x Productivity', 'content': "It’s been reported that 43% of CRM users only use less than half the features of their CRM system.

# article_291_dakota-marketplace-8-key-features-to-get-you-start

{'title': 'Dakota Marketplace: 8 Key Features to Get You Started', 'introduction': 'If you’re a new Dakota Marketplace user, or you’re considering investing in the platform, you might be wondering where you should start. After all, Dakota Marketplace has over 10,000 accounts, 31,000 contacts, and over a dozen helpful features. At Dakota, we value our members and feedback, and our Membership Services team is there to help you navigate the platform 24/7. In this article, we’re highlighting some of the best features of the platform to help you get started — or decide if Marketplace is the best fit for your firm. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear idea of the top 8 Marketplace features and how you can use them to grow your business and meet your goals. How to get started in Dakota Marketplace In this section, we’ll jump into some of the key components of the platform and how we’ve seen our current members find success with them. 1. List building and custom reports List building and custom reports are two of the most-used features within Dakota Marketplace. This functionality allows you to create custom views and reports on exactly the firms, asset classes, and people you most want to do business with. Not sure how to build a list or report? Just reach out! Our Membership Services team is constantly helping new members pull these lists together. Reach out to one of our Customer Success Managers for assistance with getting started and we’ll help you pull together a curated and customized list or report your firm. This functionality helps ensure that your most viewed and valuable information is just a click away. Finally, there are plenty of templated reports ready to go within Marketplace that you can work from before you ever need to build your own! 2. Job and role changes We know that the investment industry moves fast. With people constantly moving jobs and changing roles, it can be hard to track down the person you’re trying to reach out to. Marketplace’s job and role change feature helps you make sure that you’re always calling on the right person, in the right role, at the right place, without wasting any time on bad emails and contact information — just think of it as your number one source of warm leads! 3. Map It Do you travel to meet with clients and prospects frequently? If the answer is yes, then the Map It feature is the one for you. With Map It, you’ll be able to maximize your day by booking additional meetings, figuring out where you’re going to stay, and outlining how far you’re going to travel between meetings. One thing we always talk about at Dakota is the importance of city scheduling. City scheduling means making the most of your time in a given city or state and setting meetings with as many firms as possible while you’re there. Map It makes this not just possible, but incredibly simple. Find the best route for your day, make sure you’ve got the address right for each place ahead of time, and more. 4. Manager presentation decks Marketplace is home to more than one hundred manager presentation decks that you can view before you meet with someone. In Marketplace, you’ll have access to over 150 presentations given to public pension funds by other managers for insights into what other managers are saying and investing in. This equips you with the knowledge of what others are saying to the firms you’re meeting with beforehand, so you have a competitive advantage. 5. Public plan minutes If you’re calling on public pension funds, the Public Plan Minutes housed in Dakota Marketplace are for you. These minutes are compiled daily by our data team, and provide key insights from public pension committee meetings as they happen. You can opt in to receive daily reports of public pension investment committee meeting notes including recent hires, RFPs, portfolio allocation changes, and more, as well as access the complete library of past public plan minutes within Marketplace. 6. Searches Finding out about a new search early on can be critical, and our searches feature helps you make sure you’re never left in the dark when a new search is listed. With searches, you can opt in to receive comprehensive institutional investment search alerts delivered directly to your inbox via email. In 2021 alone there were over 300 searches added to Dakota Marketplace. 7. Investment stats A key element to the Dakota sales process is “always know what to say.” This means always being prepared before a meeting, doing your research and due diligence on a firm before you meet with them. The investment statistics included in Dakota Marketplace make that simple, as these stats are right at your fingertips. You can determine how you’re going to target accounts based on where they’ve allocated previously, see their underlying investments, and then decide if you’re ready to reach out for a meeting. 8. Homepage The Marketplace homepage is your one-stop shop and the main hub of updates on Job Changes/Role Changes. Most recently, we’ve added Dakota Live! Calls, and a comment activity stream from current members. You’ll also find new investments, accounts and contacts that have been added to the platform.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'Dakota Marketplace: 8 Key Features to Get You Started', 'content': 'If you’re a new Dakota Marketplace user, or you’re considering investing in the platform, you might be wondering where you should start. After all, Dakota Marketplace has over 10,000 accounts, 31,000 contacts, and over a dozen helpful features. At Dakota, we value our members and feedback, and our Membership Services team is there to help you navigate the platform 24/7. In this article, we’re highlighting some of the best features of the platform to help you get started — or decide if Marketplace is the best fit for your firm. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear idea of the top 8 Marketplace features and how you can use them to grow your business and meet your goals. How to get started in Dakota Marketplace In this section, we’ll jump into some of the key components of the platform and how we’ve seen our current members find success with them. 1. List building and custom reports List building and custom reports are two of the most-used features within Dakota Marketplace. This functionality allows you to create custom views and reports on exactly the firms, asset classes, and people you most want to do business with. Not sure how to build a list or report? Just reach out! Our Membership Services team is constantly helping new members pull these lists together. Reach out to one of our Customer Success Managers for assistance with getting started and we’ll help you pull together a curated and customized list or report your firm. This functionality helps ensure that your most viewed and valuable information is just a click away. Finally, there are plenty of templated reports ready to go within Marketplace that you can work from before you ever need to build your own! 2. Job and role changes We know that the investment industry moves fast. With people constantly moving jobs and changing roles, it can be hard to track down the person you’re trying to reach out to. Marketplace’s job and role change feature helps you make sure that you’re always calling on the right person, in the right role, at the right place, without wasting any time on bad emails and contact information — just think of it as your number one source of warm leads! 3. Map It Do you travel to meet with clients and prospects frequently? If the answer is yes, then the Map It feature is the one for you. With Map It, you’ll be able to maximize your day by booking additional meetings, figuring out where you’re going to stay, and outlining how far you’re going to travel between meetings. One thing we always talk about at Dakota is the importance of city scheduling. City scheduling means making the most of your time in a given city or state and setting meetings with as many firms as possible while you’re there. Map It makes this not just possible, but incredibly simple. Find the best route for your day, make sure you’ve got the address right for each place ahead of time, and more. 4. Manager presentation decks Marketplace is home to more than one hundred manager presentation decks that you can view before you meet with someone. In Marketplace, you’ll have access to over 150 presentations given to public pension funds by other managers for insights into what other managers are saying and investing in. This equips you with the knowledge of what others are saying to the firms you’re meeting with beforehand, so you have a competitive advantage. 5. Public plan minutes If you’re calling on public pension funds, the Public Plan Minutes housed in Dakota Marketplace are for you. These minutes are compiled daily by our data team, and provide key insights from public pension committee meetings as they happen. You can opt in to receive daily reports of public pension investment committee meeting notes including recent hires, RFPs, portfolio allocation changes, and more, as well as access the complete library of past public plan minutes within Marketplace. 6. Searches Finding out about a new search early on can be critical, and our searches feature helps you make sure you’re never left in the dark when a new search is listed. With searches, you can opt in to receive comprehensive institutional investment search alerts delivered directly to your inbox via email. In 2021 alone there were over 300 searches added to Dakota Marketplace. 7. Investment stats A key element to the Dakota sales process is “always know what to say.” This means always being prepared before a meeting, doing your research and due diligence on a firm before you meet with them. The investment statistics included in Dakota Marketplace make that simple, as these stats are right at your fingertips. You can determine how you’re going to target accounts based on where they’ve allocated previously, see their underlying investments, and then decide if you’re ready to reach out for a meeting. 8. Homepage The Marketplace homepage is your one-stop shop and the main hub of updates on Job Changes/Role Changes. Most recently, we’ve added Dakota Live! Calls, and a comment activity stream from current members. You’ll also find new investments, accounts and contacts that have been added to the platform.', 'bullet_points': [], 'subsections': []}], 'key_takeaways': [], 'faqs': []}

# article_323_top-rias-on-the-east-coast-of-florida

{'title': 'Top RIAs on the East Coast of Florida', 'introduction': "One of the biggest problems when selling to the RIA (Registered Investment Adviser) marketplace is the sheer size of the channel. The RIA marketplace across the United States consists of over 36,000 firms, which means that while there are plenty to choose from when looking for new clients, shrinking the list down to only those that allocate to outside managers is key. For example, here at Dakota, where we’ve raised over $6 billion from over 350 RIAs, and we qualify and curate our list to only RIAs that allocate to outside managers (which are the firms we sell for). In an effort to help narrow down the sheer size of the market, we’ve put together a list of the top 6 RIAs in each major metro area across the country. To determine our list, we looked for three things: An AUM above $200 million A dedicated analyst team An RIA that actively allocates capital to outside investment management firms We have qualified all of the RIAs on this list so that they meet our criteria. We actively call on these RIAs, and all of them can be found within our institutional investor database, Dakota Marketplace.

# article_349_20-reasons-to-start-your-career-in-saas-sales

{'title': '20+ Reasons to Start Your Career in SaaS Sales', 'introduction': "Graduating from — or even starting — college in an uncertain environment like the one we are currently in can be daunting. You might not know yet what you want to do after graduating, what to major in, or where to get started along the way. Internships are a great way to get your career started, but those are competitive and can be hard to come by. Because we know how difficult it can be, we wanted to take some time to share some of the valuable lessons we think you can learn through a career in software sales. At Dakota, we’ve been in the software sales business since 2018, and have seen our team grow and change rapidly in that time. And, as a 54-year-old CEO of that same fast-growing SaaS business, I have learned a few things over the years. Because I still see myself as a salesperson, and because I believe everybody is, to some extent, in sales, I am here to make a case for a career in sales and in this particular instance, SaaS sales. In this article, I’m going to outline some of the most important things you can learn in your first year as a software salesperson. By the end of the article, you’ll have a much better sense of everything you can get from a career in a SaaS environment, and whether or not it’s a fit for you and your skills. Is SaaS sales a lucrative career choice? The short answer here is: yes. The reason for this is simple: I believe you need to make life easier on yourself when considering what to do after you graduate from college rather than harder. Embarking in a career in sales is a great way to do just that. It’s a role that can be fast-growing, lucrative, and rewarding. However, you do need to think through where you want to be in the future. Let’s say, however, that you're not quite sure to start. Consider a few things that you have control over as you make career decisions: Choose an industry that is growing and hopefully fast growing (software, SaaS) Pick a job that has good economics associated with it (e.g. compensation) like recurring revenue and subscription revenue. The next thing is to map out, at a very basic level, what skills you are developing in the industry and role you are choosing. Good workers are very valuable, regardless of your role (website manager, data leader, sales, marketing, client service, finance, technology, etc). Basically, can you get stuff done? Can you communicate progress to your team? This is a key component of any career, not just sales, and something that will set you apart. Starting your career in software/SaaS sales provides you with the proper foundation for success in business. One of the key things is that the skills you learn in the job you will use for life are highly transferable, meaning you are building your skills brick by brick. A highly competitive individual who presents themselves well is ideally suited to launch their career in software/SaaS sales. You can learn the basics quickly and move up quickly depending upon the amount of practice time you put in. Next I’ll touch on some of the many things you will learn and encounter throughout your first year as a software salesperson. 25 things (at a minimum) you will learn as a SaaS salesperson How to build relationships The importance of asking for things The importance of delivering value first to your prospects How to manage a one-person business The business economics of a SaaS business How to set-up a meeting How to use Salesforce.com How to “demo” a product The importance of subscription revenue How to upsell by adding more value to your customer What it means to create a large total addressable market (TAM) How to tell a product story in a powerful way How to use a wide variety of other software platforms The role marketing plays in the sales process How to take a prospect through a sales process The importance of teamwork at work The importance of communication with your teammates The importance of culture and how it accelerates growth How to launch a new product How to price a product How to write emails that get high response rates How to call a prospect to introduce yourself and set-up a meeting How to shoot video How to ask the proper questions of your prospect How to sell At the end of your first year you will have built a foundation of world class business skills and in all likelihood will be an Account Executive Leading a team of three business development reps.

{'title': "Form ADV Data: Why It's Essential for Investment Sales Professionals", 'introduction': "In the complex world of investment sales, transparency and regulatory compliance are paramount - one of the key tools ensuring this transparency is Form ADV data.

If you are familiar with us at Dakota, you probably know we love RIAs - they are a goldmine for any investment sales professional. Form ADV data provides critical information about an adviser's business practices, fees, conflicts of interest, and disciplinary history so understanding and utilizing this data is crucial. These filings offer a detailed snapshot of an adviser's operations and regulatory status, enabling sales professionals to make well-informed decisions. In this article we are going to review five reasons why Form ADV data is essential to any investment sales professional. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of their importance to help towards your fundraising efforts. Conducting due diligence Due diligence is the backbone of any successful investment strategy. Form ADV provides a wealth of information that allows investment sales professionals to thoroughly vet RIAs.

# article_388_14-questions-to-ask-before-you-buy-an-institutiona

{'title': '14 Questions to Ask Before You Buy an Institutional Investor Database', 'introduction': 'Imagine finding the perfect piece of software that will totally transform how you and your team do business. Whether it’s a CRM, a new institutional investor database, or something else entirely, you know — without a doubt — that it will be worth your company’s time and money. If you’ve had this eureka moment before, you already know what comes next: the pitch to the team, and of course, the questions. We can promise that there will be plenty of questions, regarding everything from cost and functionality to implementation and then some. It can seem overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be. Here at Dakota, where we’ve raised over $30 billion since 2006, we’re no strangers to buying (and as of 2018, selling) institutional investor databases. So, we’ve faced our fair share of questions, and we know how to answer them. Our first piece of advice? Always be prepared. To help you do just that, in this article we’ll break down the questions you should be asking your team and your potential database partners before buying an institutional investor database. And, of course, providing our answers and insights to those questions. By the end of this post, you’ll have all the answers you need to crush any questions that come to you, so that you can move forward and start transforming the way your team uses data as soon as possible. Questions to ask your team before you subscribe to an institutional investor database 1. How many accounts and contacts do you need? Some databases (like Preqin and Discovery Data) are bigger and have more accounts and contacts within them, while others are more scaled down and focused on specific channels (like RIA Database or Dakota Marketplace). Once you know the extent of your team’s needs and goals, you’ll be able to decide which institutional investor database is best for you. 2. What is your budget? Institutional investor databases typically range in price from $5,000 to $15,000, which can make a significant difference for some firms. Knowing where you fall in this range, as well as how many licenses you will need will help narrow down the pool of options. Next, we’ll talk about the questions you’ll want to ask a salesperson as you explore your institutional investor database options. What to ask an institutional investor database provider 1. What channels does the database focus on? Like we mentioned at the top of this article, databases come in a variety of specificities and sizes. Some cover multiple channels, while others are more specific. Asking a salesperson right off the bat which channels their database includes is the fastest way to know if they meet your team’s needs. 2. How up to date and accurate is the data within the database? When it comes time to present a new database to your team, this is definitely something they’ll want to know about. Databases are often thought of as stale and outdated, but that’s not always the case. In fact, we’d argue that in most cases it’s not. However, some databases are updated weekly or even daily, while others are bigger and therefore take more time to update. Knowing what you’re getting into up front is important, because if a database isn’t updated frequently, it might require your team to intervene in the interim. This isn’t a downside exactly, but it is something to be aware of. 3. What contacts are in the database, and are their titles up to date? In our experience, most investment sales people want access to due diligence contacts. However, no matter what your team is looking for in a database, asking up front what types of contacts, including roles and job titles, are included will save you time in the long run. 4. How is the user interface designed? Additionally, is the interface intuitive? Can you access the information you need easily? We’ve found that in a lot of cases, if a database is difficult to navigate, or if salespeople can’t find relevant information, they won’t adopt it, resulting in a lot of wasted money and time. Knowing that a system is user-friendly and meets the needs and capabilities of your team is critical in moving forward with any new product, but especially one that directly relates to sales. 5. How long does it take to implement? Knowing how much time and how many resources will be involved in implementing a database will help your team plan and make arrangements for the new system, without any unexpected bottlenecks arising. In many cases, implementation takes a day or less, but can vary depending on the number of user licenses involved. 6. What does it cost? And does the base price change depending on the number of licenses purchased? These tend to be the first questions decision makers ask about a new product or service, and the hardest answer to find on a lot of websites. Asking about price, as well as how it relates to license, early on will save you time and keep you on-budget. 7. What channels are included in the database? A more general database will include a variety of channels, including public pensions, foundations, endowments, RIAs, and others. If you are looking for information on a specific channel, it’s important to know early on if it’s included in a potential database subscription. 8. Will I have to update it myself? The hardest part of having access to data is knowing that, at some point in the not so distant future, it will become outdated. Contacts will change jobs, or change roles within their current firm, and you won’t know about it. As salespeople, we feel this frustration, too. Asking up front if you’ll need to manipulate and update data yourself, or if it is updated regularly for you, is critical. At the end of the day, the answer to this question can mean the difference between saving your team time and costing them time. 9. Does the database have investment preferences and account descriptions? When it comes to institutional investor databases, it’s not just the accounts and contacts that matter, but the detail surrounding them. Investment preferences and account descriptions makes any salesperson’s job easier. 10. Can it connect to a CRM? Having a CRM and a database is the ideal setup for an institutional investment salesperson. However, having a CRM and a database that can speak to each other is even better, and can make your team even more efficient. Asking up front about these capabilities will help determine which database is right for you. 11. Do you include any search capabilities? Being able to quickly locate what you need is important, especially if you have limited time to research. 12. Do you have any mapping functionality? This comes into play when you’re planning a trip to a particular city, and want to make the most of your trip by scheduling as many meetings as possible while you’re there. A maps feature in a database allows you to add that additional layer of efficiency without leaving the application. 13. How do you get the data, through web scrapers or by hand? This is another question that comes up a lot when databases are being considered. How the data gets in the system and how it’s updated makes a difference. If it’s being pulled in by web scrapers, there is the potential for inaccuracy, while if it’s being updated by an in-house team, it is likely being done more carefully, leaving less room for error. 14. What types of salespeople use this database? Do other people in your industry use this? Can this vouch for its accuracy and usefulness? Many firms like to know they’re not alone in using a particular product, and databases are no different. Knowing that other firms of your type and size have used a database can help bolster confidence internally. How to bring the idea of an institutional investor database to your team You’re here wondering what questions you should be asking before you buy, and now that we’ve answered them, here’s your next step: start evaluating your options using the above criteria, so that you can narrow down your choices and start setting meetings.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': '14 Questions to Ask Before You Buy an Institutional Investor Database', 'content': 'Imagine finding the perfect piece of software that will totally transform how you and your team do business.

If you are looking for information on a specific channel, it’s important to know early on if it’s included in a potential database subscription. 8. Will I have to update it myself? The hardest part of having access to data is knowing that, at some point in the not so distant future, it will become outdated. Contacts will change jobs, or change roles within their current firm, and you won’t know about it. As salespeople, we feel this frustration, too. Asking up front if you’ll need to manipulate and update data yourself, or if it is updated regularly for you, is critical. At the end of the day, the answer to this question can mean the difference between saving your team time and costing them time. 9. Does the database have investment preferences and account descriptions? When it comes to institutional investor databases, it’s not just the accounts and contacts that matter, but the detail surrounding them. Investment preferences and account descriptions makes any salesperson’s job easier. 10. Can it connect to a CRM? Having a CRM and a database is the ideal setup for an institutional investment salesperson. However, having a CRM and a database that can speak to each other is even better, and can make your team even more efficient. Asking up front about these capabilities will help determine which database is right for you. 11. Do you include any search capabilities? Being able to quickly locate what you need is important, especially if you have limited time to research. 12. Do you have any mapping functionality? This comes into play when you’re planning a trip to a particular city, and want to make the most of your trip by scheduling as many meetings as possible while you’re there. A maps feature in a database allows you to add that additional layer of efficiency without leaving the application. 13. How do you get the data, through web scrapers or by hand? This is another question that comes up a lot when databases are being considered. How the data gets in the system and how it’s updated makes a difference. If it’s being pulled in by web scrapers, there is the potential for inaccuracy, while if it’s being updated by an in-house team, it is likely being done more carefully, leaving less room for error. 14. What types of salespeople use this database? Do other people in your industry use this? Can this vouch for its accuracy and usefulness? Many firms like to know they’re not alone in using a particular product, and databases are no different. Knowing that other firms of your type and size have used a database can help bolster confidence internally. How to bring the idea of an institutional investor database to your team You’re here wondering what questions you should be asking before you buy, and now that we’ve answered them, here’s your next step: start evaluating your options using the above criteria, so that you can narrow down your choices and start setting meetings.', 'bullet_points': [], 'subsections': []}], 'key_takeaways': [], 'faqs': [{'question': '14 Questions to Ask Before You Buy an Institutional Investor Database', 'answer': 'Imagine finding the perfect piece of software that will totally transform how you and your team do business. Whether it’s a CRM, a new institutional investor database, or something else entirely, you know — without a doubt — that it will be worth your company’s time and money. If you’ve had this eureka moment before, you already know what comes next: the pitch to the team, and of course, the questions. We can promise that there will be plenty of questions, regarding everything from cost and functionality to implementation and then some. It can seem overwhelming, but it doesn’t have to be. Here at Dakota, where we’ve raised over $30 billion since 2006, we’re no strangers to buying (and as of 2018, selling) institutional investor databases. So, we’ve faced our fair share of questions, and we know how to answer them. Our first piece of advice? Always be prepared. To help you do just that, in this article we’ll break down the questions you should be asking your team and your potential database partners before buying an institutional investor database. And, of course, providing our answers and insights to those questions. By the end of this post, you’ll have all the answers you need to crush any questions that come to you, so that you can move forward and start transforming the way your team uses data as soon as possible. Questions to ask your team before you subscribe to an institutional investor database 1. How many accounts and contacts do you need? Some databases (like Preqin and Discovery Data) are bigger and have more accounts and contacts within them, while others are more scaled down and focused on specific channels (like RIA Database or Dakota Marketplace). Once you know the extent of your team’s needs and goals, you’ll be able to decide which institutional investor database is best for you. 2. What is your budget? Institutional investor databases typically range in price from $5,000 to $15,000, which can make a significant difference for some firms. Knowing where you fall in this range, as well as how many licenses you will need will help narrow down the pool of options. Next, we’ll talk about the questions you’ll want to ask a salesperson as you explore your institutional investor database options. What to ask an institutional investor database provider 1. What channels does the database focus on? Like we mentioned at the top of this article, databases come in a variety of specificities and sizes. Some cover multiple channels, while others are more specific. Asking a salesperson right off the bat which channels their database includes is the fastest way to know if they meet your team’s needs. 2. How up to date and accurate is the data within the database? When it comes time to present a new database to your team, this is definitely something they’ll want to know about. Databases are often thought of as stale and outdated, but that’s not always the case. In fact, we’d argue that in most cases it’s not. However, some databases are updated weekly or even daily, while others are bigger and therefore take more time to update. Knowing what you’re getting into up front is important, because if a database isn’t updated frequently, it might require your team to intervene in the interim. This isn’t a downside exactly, but it is something to be aware of. 3. What contacts are in the database, and are their titles up to date? In our experience, most investment sales people want access to due diligence contacts. However, no matter what your team is looking for in a database, asking up front what types of contacts, including roles and job titles, are included will save you time in the long run. 4. How is the user interface designed? Additionally, is the interface intuitive? Can you access the information you need easily? We’ve found that in a lot of cases, if a database is difficult to navigate, or if salespeople can’t find relevant information, they won’t adopt it, resulting in a lot of wasted money and time. Knowing that a system is user-friendly and meets the needs and capabilities of your team is critical in moving forward with any new product, but especially one that directly relates to sales. 5. How long does it take to implement? Knowing how much time and how many resources will be involved in implementing a database will help your team plan and make arrangements for the new system, without any unexpected bottlenecks arising. In many cases, implementation takes a day or less, but can vary depending on the number of user licenses involved. 6. What does it cost? And does the base price change depending on the number of licenses purchased? These tend to be the first questions decision makers ask about a new product or service, and the hardest answer to find on a lot of websites. Asking about price, as well as how it relates to license, early on will save you time and keep you on-budget. 7. What channels are included in the database? A more general database will include a variety of channels, including public pensions, foundations, endowments, RIAs, and others. If you are looking for information on a specific channel, it’s important to know early on if it’s included in a potential database subscription. 8. Will I have to update it myself? The hardest part of having access to data is knowing that, at some point in the not so distant future, it will become outdated. Contacts will change jobs, or change roles within their current firm, and you won’t know about it. As salespeople, we feel this frustration, too.

Investment preferences and account descriptions makes any salesperson’s job easier. 10. Can it connect to a CRM?

Asking up front about these capabilities will help determine which database is right for you. 11. Do you include any search capabilities?

{'title': 'How to Hire, Train, Lead, and Manage for Real Success in the RIA Channel', 'introduction': "Have you ever felt like you should be raising money within the RIA channel, only to wonder whether or not it’s really worth the time and effort? Or worse, have you tried and failed to penetrate this channel because your sales team did not have the correct staffing, plan of attack, and training needed to break through? If you answered yes to either of these questions, this article is for you. If you manage an investment strategy, especially in a mutual fund, ETF or separate account, one of the most dynamic channels in the investment industry today is the RIA and Multi-Family Office Channel. Why is that? Because of the sheer size in assets and the size of the channel. Importantly, RIAs and MFOs are always looking for new, high quality investment ideas. Because there are over 1,200 RIAs that allocate capital to outside managers, there is an extreme opportunity to raise money in this channel. At Dakota, we know this to be true. Since 2006, our investment sales team has raised over $12B within the RIA and MFO channels. We’ve been selling in this channel for over fifteen years now, and have over 350 RIAs as clients, and we think it’s safe to say that we know the channel very well. However, the RIA channel is one of the most misunderstood channels within the industry. That is: most people don’t understand the unique dynamics that drive success in this channel. In this article, we’ll explain exactly how to penetrate the RIA channel, as well as how to hire, train, manage, and set expectations for an RIA salesperson. By the end of this article, you’ll be ready to start hiring and training your sales team to start penetrating this complex, but lucrative channel. First, we’ll dive into how to hire the right candidate for your firm. Finding the right person to fill the role of RIA salesperson at your firm First things first: You don’t necessarily need someone who is highly experienced in the RIA channel, you just need a candidate who is willing to be consistent in their approach to getting meetings with RIAs. RIAs are one the harder channels to sell to because of the large numbers and the sophistication level. However, you need to set the expectation for your salesperson to focus solely covering all the RIAs in your total addressable market (TAM). As we will talk about later, the goal is to cover the channel in totality and build a pipeline. In order to do this effectively and drive the results you need, we believe the RIA salesperson should be someone: With a level of assertiveness Who is politely aggressive Who isn’t afraid to get a lot of “no’s” With a sense of persistence. Why? Because you need to be able to get a lot of meetings and you need to do that using email and a follow up phone call. At the end of the day, the person you need is someone who is professional and personable enough that if you were to put them in front of an RIA, they would be able to carry their weight. When you’re looking for this person, the most important thing is to be sure that once you find this person (we’ve found many of these people are former athletes, people who are used to competing), they are ready to hit the ground running. Once you provide your new salesperson with the industry and sales training necessary, they will have the spirit and be persistent enough to make real strides in the RIA channel. How to train a new salesperson to attack the RIA channel effectively At Dakota, our sales training begins with The Dakota Way. You might be wondering what this is and how you can apply it to your business. We can help you do exactly that. The Dakota Way is a sales methodology that has helped the Dakota sales team raise over $40 billion since 2006. It’s made up of three components: Know who to call on, Know what to say, and Have a killer follow-up system. Separately, these things may seem simple, but when combined, they can create a powerful sales process that will lead your team to success. Below, we'll explain each piece of The Dakota Way and how you can apply it. 1. Know Who to Call On The primary focus of your sales effort should be to people who buy what you sell. Figuring out who this audience is and how to reach them is the first step to sales success. If you specialize in mutual funds, you need to call on allocators who deal in mutual funds: RIAs, ETFs, and separate accounts. Keep in mind that identifying the appropriate channels and contacts within each account can take a lot of time and legwork before you ask for a meeting. The key here is not to waste time convincing the wrong buyer that you might be a fit for them. In short: sell apples to apple-buyers, don’t try and tell an orange-buyer that they might like an apple instead. 2. Know What to Say Unfortunately, this step is often overlooked, but it’s so critical. Simply getting a meeting with the right person is not enough. To win business, you need to master the art of the pitch. Institutional investors need to understand your story and how you got to your performance numbers. You’ll have to use carefully chosen words to bring your story to life while addressing the questions an institutional investor wants answered. Talking performance won’t be enough. 3. Have a Killer Follow-Up System After getting to the meeting and nailing the pitch, it’s critical that you follow up. Almost everyone sends a thank-you email with some marketing materials. But that is table stakes. It’s the logging of those meetings into a CRM that is the critical step to get maximum leverage. If your follow-up begins and ends with a single generic email, building a pipeline will be difficult. You need a follow-up system that helps trigger sales actions so you can effortlessly continue the conversation with the allocators you have met with in a meaningful way. With this sales methodology in mind, Know Who to Call On (build a TAM); Know What to Say (be a master messenger); and Have a Killer Follow up System (log all your meetings for leverage), your sales team will be prepared to attack the RIA channel. How big is the RIA channel? Part and parcel to the hiring process is the execution of a plan of attack. This is where the rubber meets the road in terms of having success in the RIA channel. We’ve identified over 1,200 RIAs that allocate to outside managers. For those of you who are not familiar with what that means, the SEC currently has roughly 14,500 Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs). The large majority of those RIAs are money managers: investment firms that pick stocks, invest in private equity, invest in private credit, and pick portfolios of fixed income. They are not wealth managers, and they don’t allocate funds on behalf of clients. What this means is that you and your team would need to go through those 14,500 firms and identify the RIAs who do allocate to outside managers. The good news? We’ve done that for you within Dakota Marketplace. Once you know who the 1,200 RIAs are, you simply need to start reaching out to set up meetings. More detail below on how to do just that. How to break into the RIA channel Once you hire a salesperson, there needs to be a clear business plan. What is your sales plan? How are you going to attack these 1,200 RIAs? Well, in our experience there are two key ways to do this. 1. Attack them from the top down. If you have a twelve month plan, then you’ll want to look at the next year, and say to yourself, okay, “How can I go from the top down?” You will want to introduce your strategy to the largest firms first, and get your firm and strategy in front of them. 2. Attack the RIAs city by city. Anyone who has raised money knows that when you travel to a city, you’ll try and pack as many meetings into that trip as possible. At Dakota, we call this city scheduling. This is built around metro areas. Start with NYC, Boston, Philadelphia, Washington, D.C., Chicago, San Francisco, L.A, Atlanta, and Dallas. Following this outline you can go into Marketplace, find the RIAs in each of these cities, and send an email to each firm in each city introducing your firm and your strategy. Then your sales team can put this into action by creating reports in your database outlining their progress. How to turn RIAs from prospects into allocations using reports At Dakota, we do this by starting at the account level. Take BBR in New York City, a $6 billion RIA. We create a custom field in our Salesforce database called “Sales Cycle.” Everyone starts out in the “prospecting” category, then as we qualify them it moves to “qualified,” then to “evaluating,” and then to the deep sales cycles. Why this is so critical is because you need to be able to look at lists of RIAs and know exactly where you stand. Applying a custom sales cycle to the Account screen makes this very easy. As you look at your account list over time, you’ll start to see that not everyone is “prospecting” anymore, they are in different sales cycles. From there, you’ll start to create an opportunity pipeline report. This means that you’ll go in and create an opportunity, and evaluate that opportunity, looking through the list from top to bottom and running the report based on sales cycle. Over time you will be able to look at the list of 1,200 RIAs and you will be able to quickly see how the sales cycles are changing from “prospecting” to the others. If you’re thirty, sixty, or ninety days into your sales cycle, you of course do not want the majority of your opportunities to be “prospecting.” As time moves on, you want to see fewer and fewer prospects, and more and more in evaluating, red zone, and more final presentations. Measuring the success of your sales team The reports we mentioned above are how you measure the success of your sales team. You as a sales leader want to see that prospecting number moving closer and closer to zero every day, as this means your sales team is out there doing just that: qualifying, setting up meetings, and selling. Eventually, you also want to zero out the “qualified” category. Maybe those RIAs don’t invest in your asset class, or they do invest in your asset class, but they already have an investment there that they’re happy with. These can be moved into the “long-term evaluation” status category, or into a specialized category noting that while they do invest in your asset class, they already have that investment they’re happy with. How to define what a “good” salesperson looks like at your firm As the sales leader or president of the company, it’s your job to set the standards for what a “good” salesperson looks like at your firm, but it’s equally important that your sales team knows and understands what “good” looks like. “Good” is not 1,200 prospects. “Good'' is not 1,200 firms marked as “qualified.” “Good” means sending introductory emails, setting meetings, getting your firm and strategy in front of the right people within those prospects, and getting feedback to move those prospects into an active sales cycle. Bottom line: “good” is being in an active sales cycle across the 1,200 or so RIAs. Once you start reviewing these reports as a team on a weekly basis, you will have a clear idea what each salesperson is doing, and what you’re judging them on is not so much how much business they are closing, but on covering their accounts and getting those accounts into sales cycles. This is the most important thing you can be tracking. Over time, the goal is to zero out all of those prospects, and to know where you stand with all of your RIA prospects. The opportunity pipeline reports will reveal all the work that comes from attacking those prospect lists. How to start setting meetings with the right people Now that you know who to hire, how to train them, and how to attack the RIA channel, it’s time to start setting meetings with qualified buyers. How do you start doing that? With an email. When you’re managing and leading this sales team member, they have to be setting meetings with allocators. Every allocation starts with an initial meeting. Nothing can happen without that. So, in order to get these meetings, you have to send that first email. The subject line of these emails should contain the person’s name, and a direct call to action, outlining the date and time you want to meet. This lets the know exactly what to expect within the email. For more details on how to write an email that packs a punch, you can read our 5 tips on getting your emails opened and responded to. Get started raising money in the RIA channel today We’ve thrown a lot at you all at once, but now it’s time to hit the ground running. You’ll want to be sure they are up and running using The Dakota Way sales methodology. Then, start creating your plan of attack, whether you choose to do this by firm size or by city, so that you can start running reports on them. Over time, you’ll start to see your number of prospects decrease, and your “evaluations,” “red zone” and “final presentations” categories growing. This is how you will know your team is beginning to see the traction you want within the RIA channel.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'How to Hire, Train, Lead, and Manage for Real Success in the RIA Channel', 'content': "Have you ever felt like you should be raising money within the RIA channel, only to wonder whether or not it’s really worth the time and effort?

How to define what a “good” salesperson looks like at your firm As the sales leader or president of the company, it’s your job to set the standards for what a “good” salesperson looks like at your firm, but it’s equally important that your sales team knows and understands what “good” looks like. “Good” is not 1,200 prospects. “Good'' is not 1,200 firms marked as “qualified.” “Good” means sending introductory emails, setting meetings, getting your firm and strategy in front of the right people within those prospects, and getting feedback to move those prospects into an active sales cycle. Bottom line: “good” is being in an active sales cycle across the 1,200 or so RIAs. Once you start reviewing these reports as a team on a weekly basis, you will have a clear idea what each salesperson is doing, and what you’re judging them on is not so much how much business they are closing, but on covering their accounts and getting those accounts into sales cycles. This is the most important thing you can be tracking. Over time, the goal is to zero out all of those prospects, and to know where you stand with all of your RIA prospects. The opportunity pipeline reports will reveal all the work that comes from attacking those prospect lists. How to start setting meetings with the right people Now that you know who to hire, how to train them, and how to attack the RIA channel, it’s time to start setting meetings with qualified buyers. How do you start doing that? With an email. When you’re managing and leading this sales team member, they have to be setting meetings with allocators. Every allocation starts with an initial meeting. Nothing can happen without that. So, in order to get these meetings, you have to send that first email. The subject line of these emails should contain the person’s name, and a direct call to action, outlining the date and time you want to meet. This lets the know exactly what to expect within the email. For more details on how to write an email that packs a punch, you can read our 5 tips on getting your emails opened and responded to. Get started raising money in the RIA channel today We’ve thrown a lot at you all at once, but now it’s time to hit the ground running. You’ll want to be sure they are up and running using The Dakota Way sales methodology. Then, start creating your plan of attack, whether you choose to do this by firm size or by city, so that you can start running reports on them. Over time, you’ll start to see your number of prospects decrease, and your “evaluations,” “red zone” and “final presentations” categories growing. This is how you will know your team is beginning to see the traction you want within the RIA channel.", 'bullet_points': [], 'subsections': []}], 'key_takeaways': [], 'faqs': []}

{'title': 'Consultant Led Private Real Estate Allocations in Q3 2024', 'introduction': "In recent months, real estate has continued to attract significant attention from institutional investors, with consultants playing a crucial role in shaping these allocation strategies. Across public pension and retirement systems in the U.S., substantial commitments have been made toward a variety of real estate funds, indicating an ongoing pursuit of yield and diversification within the sector. Major consulting firms, including The Townsend Group, StepStone Group, Hamilton Lane Advisors, and others, have been at the forefront of steering capital into property investments, from core assets to distressed opportunities.

# article_169_the-top-job-sites-for-investment-management-jobs

{'title': 'The Top Job Sites for Investment Management Jobs', 'introduction': "To work in the investment management industry is a real gift. Whether it’s on the long-only side working with world-class stock pickers or on the private side working with investors who both know how to identify great companies and help grow them post investment, it’s an amazing industry. The jobs within the investment management industry range from fundraising, sales, investor relations, consultants relations, key accounts, foundations and endowments sales, analyst, portfolio management, operations, HR, finance, product marketing and product development just to name a few. What’s a little crazy is that there is constant turnover in the industry on the sales and distribution side of the business. Raising capital is tough, not to mention for an investment firm finding the right people to focus on the right channels for a specific strategy is not always easy. Throw in market volatility, and in some cases a lack of money in motion, investment firms get frustrated and can be quick to pull the trigger on sales people. This leads to the need for ease of finding job opportunities or openings. The problem, however, is finding the right opportunity is not that easy, because most investment firms are small to medium size businesses, and there are over 12,000 globally. Most opportunities are relationship driven introductions through each firm's network. Of course not all, but with so many firms out there, it’s not easy to find opportunities. One of the big reasons is that there has not been a dedicated job board focused exclusively on the investment management industry. Job boards tend to be general in nature and lack the specifics of the exact role investment firms are looking to fill. So the challenge stands - working in the investment management industry is a dream, but with a vast array of firms and no central place to find a role for your skill set, what is someone to do? We have identified a handful of job sites for you to review to see which ones might give you the opportunity to post a job and apply for a job within the investment management industry.

# article_238_q1-2023-etf-recap

{'title': 'Q1 2023 ETF Recap', 'introduction': 'For the first time in over a year, the capital markets treated allocators well in both fixed income and equities, despite the banking specific volatility which the Fed and Treasury acted swiftly to contain in Q1 2023. This allowed allocators to take advantage of the valuation resets we have seen occur since this time last year and we saw that in flows and ETF product creation. Another positive development that occurred was a higher level of dispersion among all sub-asset classes of equities. An example of this was the tech sector ETF up 19% during the quarter VS the financial sector ETF down -7%. The higher level of dispersion during the quarter led to allocators using more sector specific ETFs and increased flows to active ETF strategies as stock picking VS index picking has begun to add alpha again. While the ETFs continue to attract net new flows VS mutual funds, equity ETFs still represent only 14% of the equity market and only 2.8% of the bond market from an AUM perspective. Looking at turnover however, trading volume as a percentage of total U.S. equity volume reached nearly 40% via ETFs during the quarter. Fixed income trading also increased 13% VS last quarter, as record flows came into bonds due to higher yields available and does not appear to be slowing. Part of what fed into bond ETFs attracting flows, pulling deposits away from banks, is that real interest rates are above inflation now, and that is drawing money away from traditional savings accounts into fixed income. US ETF stats at the end of Q1 2023: YTD net inflows of $81 B are the fourth highest on record 11th month of consecutive net inflows. Assets of $6.90 Tn invested in ETFs and ETPs listed in US at the end of Q1 ETF AUM increased 6.1% in Q1 2023, going from $6.51 T at end of 2022 to $6.90 T At the close of Q1, MarketPlace was tracking 3340 ETFs from 297 individual asset managers sponsors via the 13F filings. For the quarter this amounts to over 350k individual positions which are linked to an allocator inside of MarketPlace This is a net increase of 30 new ETF managers/sponsors, however only net new 12 ETFs VS the last quarter of 2023 due to closures and a reminder that an exchange has the right to kick off ETFs that do not maintain minimum volume and liquidity requirements. Looking fund closures, these are up 200% YoY as 58 ETFs have liquidated in Q1 as allocators have become more selective in how they deploy cash…especially now that cash is an asset class again. Many of the closures took place in the thematic, digital crypto, and SPAC based area as asset managers rationalized their lineups. Launches are down slightly during Q1 at 20% YoY with 94 new ETFs coming to market. There was a noticeable drop in ESG themed ETFs with 58 coming to market VS 101 during the same time last year. Higher expense ratios and political headlines have created a headwind to sustained interest. Some stats on the asset classes and sub-asset classes launched: Equity large core 14 funds, third quarter in a row in the top issuance Options /buffered 12 funds, these are now consistently issued as many have monthly expirations and have become popular hedges Materials/commodity 6 fund, Sprott launched a series a metals linked ETFs tied to EV and other high value minerals Ultrashort Investment Grade 5 funds, taking advantage of higher front end bond yields 61 of 94 launched funds were actively managed, with only 5 using an ANT (active non-transparent wrapper. The ANT wrapper continues to struggle because major broker-dealers have been slow to add them to their platforms. 19 funds are ESG themed or focused 2 Smart Beta funds were launched, the lowest in over 4 years. The universe of actively managed strategies continues to grow as there are now 1,113 actively managed ETFs. Q1 saw inflows into actively managed ETFs meaningfully take share at 33% of ETF net new money with JPMorgan and DFA taking the majority of the flow. All major active ETF asset classes saw net inflows except for alternatives which were flat, losing the breakneck momentum they had in 2022. Interestingly, an allocator commented on our show earlier in the year that they expected money to leave alts and go back into traditional asset classes. ETF Launches that we thought were of interest among the Q1 13 F filings: Unlimited’s launch of their ETF, the Unlimited HFNDMulti-Strategy Return Tracker ETF (HFND ), HFND seeks to replicate the risk and return profile of the hedge fund industry within the ETF wrapper that offers lower cost diversification opportunities and a tax-efficient return stream for investors. The fund is actively managed and uses modern machine learning in a type of “sophisticated Monte Carlo simulation” or Bayesian model to analyze the hedge fund industry return stream to pinpoint individual factors such as macro, fixed income, etc. While ESG flows have slowed, allocators are looking to peel out parts of the ESG market. The KraneShares Global Carbon Strategy ETF (KRBN ) was launched and offers exposure through the futures market to the largest, most liquid regulated carbon markets globally that set caps on how much entities can pollute each year, issuing a set number of allowances to each participant every year.

{'title': 'Navigating Technology and Strategy: Schwab Impact 2024 Highlights', 'introduction': "Attending investment industry conferences is more than just a chance to network; it's an opportunity to gain valuable insights, stay ahead of emerging trends, and build connections that can shape both individual careers and entire organizations. At Dakota, we know the impact of these events firsthand – our team regularly attends conferences like Schwab Impact to stay attuned to industry shifts and bring back insights that fuel our approach to client success. The Schwab Impact Conference 2024 brought together leading minds from across the financial industry to share insights, strategies, and tools shaping the future of financial advising. With thought-provoking sessions and expert panels, this year’s event offered a deep dive into navigating industry challenges and unlocking growth in a competitive landscape. In this article, we’ll recap our key takeaways from the conference. By the end, you’ll have a clearer understanding of positioning your firm for success in today’s dynamic financial environment. Redefining Growth: Lessons for RIAs One recurring theme throughout the conference was the challenge of sustainable growth for RIAs. A speaker from a leading CRM Software firm highlighted the stark performance gap between the top 20% of firms and the rest of the market. The key? A proactive approach to growth that leverages both client relationships and innovative marketing. RIAs were encouraged to return to the basics – client referrals remain the cornerstone of success, accounting for 70% of growth. Business partner referrals and thoughtful marketing strategies also play a crucial role. The session underscored the importance of nurturing existing client relationships, with top-performing firms in 2023 gaining 4.5 times more assets from current clients than their peers. Digital onboarding was another area of focus. Creating seamless, customized client experiences not only sets a positive tone for the relationship but also boosts trust and referrals. Standardized processes that balance digital convenience with a personal touch were hailed as the gold standard. M&A: A Growth Path with Momentum The panel discussion on mergers and acquisitions painted a fascinating picture of the industry’s future, and explored how RIAs can prepare for strategic acquisitions or sales. Despite a plateau following the record-breaking activity of 2021, M&A remains robust. Panelists shared that 70% of recent transactions were driven by private equity-backed firms, signaling the continued dominance of institutional capital in shaping the industry. Succession planning is expected to fuel the next wave of transactions, providing both opportunities and challenges for RIAs. New call-to-action The FinTech Revolution: Harnessing AI for a Competitive Edge A highlight of the conference was the deep dive into artificial intelligence and its transformative role in financial advising. AI tools are becoming indispensable for tasks like investment management, credit assessments, and even predicting market sentiment through social media trends. Yet, speakers were quick to emphasize the irreplaceable value of human intuition, particularly in high-stakes situations requiring creativity and judgment. The conversation also touched on the importance of selecting the right financial planning software. Integration, security, and client-centric features were identified as critical factors for maximizing efficiency and enhancing the client experience. A Blueprint for Organic Growth For firms looking to scale sustainably, the session on multi-channel marketing offered a treasure trove of insights. Education-based marketing emerged as a standout strategy, with advisors finding success through workshops, multi-day classes, and even financial education podcasts and YouTube content. Paid, multi-day classes were noted for attracting highly engaged participants, while shorter workshops appealed to a wider audience. A blend of these approaches, supported by a robust digital strategy, ensures both reach and engagement. The key takeaway? Consistency across channels. Whether repurposing content for podcasts or developing referral programs, firms need a cohesive strategy that integrates traditional and digital marketing methods. Looking to the Horizon As the Schwab Impact Conference 2024 drew to a close, one thing was clear: the financial industry is evolving rapidly. The firms that will thrive are those that combine technology with a human touch, approach growth with intention, and continuously innovate to meet the changing needs of their clients. This year’s conference served as a powerful reminder of the opportunities ahead and the strategies needed to seize them. Whether through mergers, advanced technology, or personalized client experiences, RIAs have the tools to build a brighter future.

# article_086_insights-from-ipem-2024-navigating-the-future-of-p

{'title': 'Insights from IPEM 2024: Navigating the Future of Private Markets', 'introduction': "In the fast-paced world of investment management, staying ahead of industry trends and forging meaningful connections are crucial to success. This is where conferences come into play, particularly those focused on investment management. These events provide unparalleled opportunities to connect with industry peers, gain insights from leading experts, and stay updated on the latest market developments. Attending industry conferences like IPEM allows professionals to stay informed about emerging opportunities, sharpen their strategies, and maintain a competitive edge in an ever-evolving landscape. The IPEM (International Private Equity Market) Conference is one of the leading events for private equity professionals and investors worldwide, designed to foster collaboration, share insights, and explore the latest trends in the global investment landscape. Each year, the event brings together industry leaders, institutional investors, and innovators to discuss the opportunities and challenges facing the private markets. This year, Dakota attended the IPEM Conference, where insightful panels and discussions covered a wide array of topics. From private equity and credit markets to infrastructure and sports investing, the event provided a comprehensive look into how the investment market is evolving. The conference was a valuable opportunity to learn from industry experts and gain perspective on the shifting dynamics that are shaping the future of private capital. In this article, we are discussing our key takeaways we brought back from this year's IPEM conference. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of these key insights. Key takeaways The IPEM conference 2024 showcased the resilience and ongoing growth opportunities in private markets despite some challenges. Across various panels, speakers highlighted how private equity continues to perform strongly, even as distribution issues and over-allocation have slowed deal-making. Investors are increasingly looking to non-sponsored lending, capital solutions, and asset-backed securities as banks pull back due to tighter regulations. This shift reflects the evolving landscape in private markets, where flexibility and innovative financing solutions are driving growth. A notable theme throughout the conference was the positive shift in investor sentiment, particularly in the context of fundraising. While 2019 to 2021 saw investors driven by FOMO (Fear of Missing Out), today's environment is marked by renewed excitement and optimism about fundraising opportunities. This is especially evident in the mega deal space, which is regaining momentum. Large deals are making a comeback, but with a greater focus on exit options and strategic confidence. While investors are hesitant to lead the charge, the opportunities for well-positioned deals remain significant. Private credit themes Private credit is becoming increasingly democratized, presenting both opportunities and risks. Expanding access to private credit for a broader range of investors is generally viewed as positive, and we’re now seeing the influence of this through the growing interest in private credit ETFs. As highlighted in a recent fundraising news article from Dakota, State Street Global Advisors (SSGA) and Apollo Global Management announced their plan to collaborate on a private credit ETF, and shortly after, BondBloxx filed its own application for such a fund on September 13. This move could potentially spark a private credit ETF race among major Wall Street firms, aiming to tap into strong retail demand as institutional interest cools. However, there are concerns that less experienced investors may not fully grasp the illiquidity and long-term nature of private credit investments, which could prompt increased regulatory scrutiny. Such oversight might inadvertently impact seasoned investors who have long navigated this space. Additionally, the rise of continuation vehicles and secondaries has transformed the market, where both niche and large GPs are well-positioned to thrive. In contrast, mid-sized firms lacking scale or specialization may face a more challenging future in this evolving landscape. Private market themes Private wealth investors, particularly high-net-worth (HNW) individuals, continue to drive growth in fundraising. Ardian had mentioned that last year was their second largest fundraising year ever, with a quarter of the funds raised from private wealth channels. As the appetite for alternative investments grows, there is a pressing question of how to better serve the mass affluent, who often lack adequate access to private markets. Tapping into this demographic could provide a major boost to the private equity landscape, especially as institutional investors maintain their strong presence in the market. Infrastructure themes In Europe, long-term partnerships between private investors and governments are becoming increasingly crucial. Infrastructure investing remains politically neutral and continues to offer substantial benefits, particularly in terms of job creation and GDP growth. Mega deals, such as KKR’s acquisition of Telecom Italia, underscore the vast opportunities available in the infrastructure space. As private capital takes on a larger role in supporting essential services and national assets, we can expect to see more of these large-scale deals emerge. It will be interesting to watch how this trend evolves and whether it expands beyond Europe to other regions. Sports investing themes Lastly, the world of sports investing is undergoing a seismic shift as it becomes an accessible asset class for institutional capital for the first time. Both MLB and the NFL have recently allowed institutional investors to enter the market, creating new opportunities for growth in this once-exclusive space. Sports franchises are seen as strong, long-term investments, but liquidity remains a key concern. As with other emerging markets, selling large assets in sports is challenging due to limited approved buyers and the nascent state of secondary markets. Start embracing opportunity In conclusion, the IPEM conference made it clear that while private markets are facing new challenges, they remain an attractive and evolving space. From sports franchises to infrastructure and private wealth channels, the future of private markets is marked by innovation, long-term thinking, and a cautious yet optimistic approach to growth. Investors are shifting strategies, focusing on flexible solutions, and tapping into new opportunities to ensure they remain ahead in this dynamic landscape.

# article_309_crm-data-hygiene-for-investment-firms-what-is-it-a

{'title': 'CRM Data Hygiene for Investment Firms: What is it and How Do You Maintain It?', 'introduction': 'If you are in the sales business in any industry, you already know that a CRM can be a double edged sword. It can —and should— be the number one sales tool that enables teams to drive business and build relationships. But it can also be a major pain point throughout your work day. What makes the difference here is the quality of the data within the CRM. If your sales team knows that it’s full of outdated, essentially useless data, they won’t use it, and the CRM won’t get adopted. If they know the data is helpful, will allow them to schedule more meetings with qualified buyers, and contains the critical information they need to meet their goals, it becomes a whole new ballgame. Many CRM users assume that the data in their CRM is clean and ready to be used by the sales team. However, without regular clean up, a team of dedicated administrators ensuring the data is up to date, and regular data hygiene checks, this is likely not the case. In fact, 44% of businesses in a recent study said that they lose over 10% in annual revenue due to low-quality CRM data. That is a lot of money being left on the table due to bad data. So, what can you do to make sure your CRM is updated and full of useful, accurate data? Luckily, there are a lot of small, manageable steps you can take to promote data hygiene within your CRM. In this article, we’re going to go through common misconceptions about CRM data, health, Salesforce best practices, and recommendations that will help you get ahead of your bad data problem. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear understanding of next steps and best practices. What is CRM Data Hygiene and Why Is It Important? You might be wondering what a data hygiene check is and how you do it. The answer is simple. A data hygiene check is a regular review of your CRM and the data within it, to ensure that the data is clean and updated. This could be anything from removing bad data, eliminating duplication, adding additional clean data to enrich contacts, or correcting inaccuracies in the data. When it comes to data entry, especially data entry done by multiple people, human error is inevitable. That means things will be entered incorrectly, data will be duplicated, and there will be inconsistent information over time. Reviewing your data on a consistent basis ensures that these things are remedied and do not grow as time goes on. Reviewing data can mean correcting several things including: Duplicate records and data Contact names that are misspelled or capitalized correctly or consistently Addresses, roles, or job titles that are inaccurate or incomplete Fields that are inaccurate or missing data altogether Once these areas are cleaned up, the CRM will not only be easier to use, but will make your sales team up to ten times more efficient. This can look like: Better relationships with clients, leading to more renewals More meetings and closed deals Improved segmentation for marketing efforts Manual, in-house data review vs. data cleansing tools When it comes to third parties, you can go in a few different ways. You can get your data directly from an outside source (database subscription) and import it into your CRM or use an outsourced database administrator. A database subscription: You pay a yearly subscription fee in exchange for access to a database of accounts and contacts within the investment industry. These are specialized to fit the needs of the industry, and come in a variety of sizes, from hundreds of thousands of accounts and contacts, to a more scaled down list. Depending on the database your team chooses, you still might need to verify the data to ensure accuracy. A database administration system: These are software options that will help ensure that your data is as up to date as possible. These types of systems, offered by companies like Oracle, SentryOne, and Redgate, are often designed to complement your data team, rather than act as a single solution to data upkeep. Next, we’ll dive into the pros and cons of third party data management. The benefits of third party data management Greater efficiency: At the end of the day, outsourcing your data and data management is going to save you and your team time. Instead of hunting for information on who to call, it’s already at your fingertips and ready to use. This allows your sales team to get to work making calls and setting meetings, which leads to more deals closed. Access to large quantities of data: A third party database is able to pull a large amount of data in a short amount of time. This means your team will have access to a ton of information without spending hours of time researching it first. Databases are especially beneficial for large projects, or for when a company is trying to get a sense of a new industry or market. The drawbacks of third party data management Your data can get stale: If you’re getting your data from a third party source or relying strictly on the industry, your data can get stale, leading to outdated contact information. Instead you need to find and update contact information yourself, or update and build relationships with people, allowing you to keep it updated with minimal effort. The data isn’t always accurate: If you’re getting data from a third party, there is no guarantee that it will be one hundred percent correct. This could mean the need for human intervention and double checking data received, or working with the third party database administration system to oversee that it is correct. In-house data management The benefits of in-house data management Real-time updates: Having a dedicated person or team within your organization means having a dedicated resource to focus on cleaning up your data, so it will always be as accurate as possible. With a third party or software, there could be delays, especially if you are working with a large data set. In an industry where data can get stale very quickly, this can be a major downside that may sway you to keep things in-house. Dedication and trust: Having someone who understands the needs and goals of your business and can be focused on them adds a layer of trust to the process that may not exist with third party resources. The drawbacks of in-house data management It can be time consuming: It is a very time-intensive process to go through all of your data each day and ensure that it’s updated and accurate. Depending on the size of your data team, you might not be able to update as much information in bulk as a third party source or system would. So, which is right for you? This ultimately depends how specialized you and your company are. If you’re looking for a broad amount of accounts and contacts, then a third party data source would be better. If you’re more specialized in a specific channel, (RIA, Consultants, etc.) then updating data in-house, or subscribing to a smaller, more manageable database would be best because it’s more specific and constantly updated. A good middle ground is subscribing to a database and employing an internal data team to maintain it, so that you are constantly being given a new set of data that is updated and accurate. If you’re not sure what level of time, resources, and commitment are right for you, we’d love to set up a fifteen-minute consultation to help review your firm’s data health, and recommend some solutions for your team.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'CRM Data Hygiene for Investment Firms: What is it and How Do You Maintain It?', 'content': 'If you are in the sales business in any industry, you already know that a CRM can be a double edged sword.

# article_330_top-10-ria-firms-in-the-charlotte-metro-area

{'title': 'Top 10 RIA Firms in the Charlotte Metro Area', 'introduction': "If you're in investment sales, you likely already know that one of the biggest problems of selling to the RIA (Registered Investment Adviser) marketplace is the sheer size of it. The RIA market across the United States consists of over 36,000 firms, which means that while there are more than enough to choose from when looking for new clients, narrowing down the list to only those that allocate to outside managers is going to be key. Here at Dakota, we’ve raised over $6 billion from over 350 RIAs, and that has been possible because we qualify and curate our list to only RIAs that allocate to outside managers. In an effort to help narrow down the sheer size of the market, we’ve put together a list of the top 10 RIAs in each major metro area across the country.

# article_365_3-ways-to-increase-crm-adoption-across-your-sales

{'title': '3 Ways to Increase CRM Adoption Across Your Sales Team', 'introduction': "A CRM is one of the most important assets for any sales team because it houses all their leads and data. What matters is the information you put in, otherwise it’s just a container. Think of your CRM like a cookie jar — full of information that allows you to email people, maintain lists, and house technology to find which emails have bounced. However, this also means that your CRM is only as good as what you put inside it. We know it can be painful to get your sales team to adopt and embrace a Customer Relationship Management software (CRM) — we’ve been there. However, we also know that there’s nothing more important to the sales enablement tech stack than a CRM. One hidden gem of a CRM is that if used properly, it can give your company and salespeople leverage. The better the data inside the CRM, the easier it is to find. In turn, this results in better, more efficient results. Companies that are dedicated to up keeping their CRM have better sales people, better marketing campaigns, better access to in-depth operations, and overall a more efficiently run operation. At Dakota, we’ve raised over $35B since 2006 by having clean and curated data within our CRM. We’ve been using Salesforce as our CRM for fifteen years, and have even created our own Salesforce App to correspond with our Dakota Marketplace platform. In this article we’re outlining three key ways to get your sales team to use a CRM effectively. By the end, you’ll be ready to empower your firm to take its data to the next level First, we’ll dive into the reasons why your sales team may not like using the CRM: 1. Infrastructure It's possible that the processes and procedures of your sales organization aren’t set up in a way that will lead to a higher CRM adoption. A classic example of this, that has never ended well, is having the sales professionals enter their call notes at the end of the week, rather than directly after a meeting. At Dakota, we’ve found that the number one thing institutional sales people hate doing is entering their call notes after a meeting. For anybody reading this article, if you’re in the investment business, you know exactly what we’re talking about. They hate executing this data entry task and procrastinate it until the end of the week. 2. They aren’t technologically savvy Because Millennials grew up using apps and technology in their everyday life, it’s more habitual for the younger generation of salespeople to keep up with their data entries and use the CRM. However, this is not the same across the board, and their peers may not be as technologically savvy. Building a culture of learning and growth mindsets can help salespeople of all ages overcome this knowledge gap. 3. The CRM is full of bad data The kryptonite to any sales team is stale data. It doesn’t take a rocket scientist to figure out that it’s frustrating to go into an account just to find that none of the contacts are up to date or several emails you sent bounced. This is one of the biggest reasons salespeople don’t like using a CRM, stale data. With Marketplace, we’ve taken a good hack at this. Because our data is up to date we’re able to hyper-focus on creating opportunities, not entering data. So the question is, how do you convince your sales team that implementing a CRM is to their benefit? We’re going to switch gears and go over three ways to change your sales team’s thinking on CRMs by making it easy for them. How to make it easy for the sales team to use a CRM 1. Train sales people properly using Salesforce Having your sales team properly trained with Salesforce will create greater efficiency in their personal sales role because they’re leveraging a very effective tool to do so. There are three main objects in any CRM: accounts, contacts, and opportunities. If you establish the fact that everyone uses opportunities to create pipeline reports, you’ll get your sales team to adopt a CRM from day one. If the culture of your company is managing the business based on opportunities, you'll want to see all the opportunities across your team. The company won’t be able to do this if you and your team aren’t religiously creating and updating their own opportunity pipeline reports. If you train your sales team to create opportunity reports, when you have your sales meetings, you will be able to review these pipeline reports on a weekly or bi-weekly basis so the whole company can review them, and see where your opportunities lie. 2. Enter meeting notes If your sales team is entering their opportunities in the CRM, they should simultaneously be entering their notes on meetings they’ve set up and completed. It’s more important for the salespeople to enter call notes than anything else. This will save you hours of time, resulting in punching above your weight. Imagine being as productive as 4-5 salespeople combined, simply by leveraging technology. This is due to the fact that you’ll no longer spend hours searching for information. It will all be in one easily accessible place. 3. Track activity Activity is referring to entering the meetings you’ve completed and attaching a contact, account, email, and phone number to this activity. Following this, you’ll set up 3 activity reports for each salesperson and their meetings/calls completed: 14, 30, and 90-day reports on all their activities. The activity reports make following up simple because they serve as reminders. You can’t follow up without entering these activity reports. At Dakota we refer to these reports as “sale triggers” because it forces you to take action in moving that relationship forward. The butterfly effect of a curated CRM Your CRM is essentially providing you with instant access to information you’d normally be searching for. This makes for a very happy, efficient sales team which ultimately makes for a happy upper management. They’re capable of running reports to see exactly what’s being done and how their pipeline is progressing. We’ve only highlighted a few benefits to utilizing a CRM, and there are many more you can read about. At the end of the day, it comes down to properly training your sales team to enter data, enter activity, and create a pipeline of activity reports. Salesforce does a magnificent job of making these reports easy to access. Your company has 100% control over whether a salesperson uses their CRM or not, but it is incumbent on the company to make it easier for their team to use the CRM. If it isn’t made easy, I guarantee you your team will become frustrated and give up on it.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': '3 Ways to Increase CRM Adoption Across Your Sales Team', 'content': "A CRM is one of the most important assets for any sales team because it houses all their leads and data.

{'title': 'What Makes a Good Company Culture? How Dakota Sets Itself Apart', 'introduction': 'If you’ve ever left a job or spent any time on LinkedIn, chances are you’ve probably heard that “people don’t leave bad jobs, they leave bad managers.” You know the posts, they’re usually in a dramatic font with a whole host of poor management qualities beneath it designed to have you nodding along. Posts like this have been made so often that by now it’s become something of a cliche. And while the sentiment is true to an extent, bad managers are often not the entire problem, but a symptom of something bigger. The broader culture within a workplace allows that bad management style to exist and persist, which leads to employee unhappiness and turnover. So while it might be that terrible, micromanaging boss that’s making you crazy every day, the one inspiring you to look on LinkedIn and Indeed every night, chances are the problem goes deeper than that. Now, in the time of the “great resignation,” it’s more important than ever that companies address their deeper, cultural problems. In fact, it’s crucial that they do so, or they’ll continue to struggle to retain their current employees and recruit new ones. As someone who has done her fair share of job-hopping over the last few years, I can say that it’s almost always something deeper than just a bad manager. It’s the way you feel while you’re at work, even — especially — if it’s a remote workplace. In this article, I’m going to outline some of the key things that make Dakota’s culture stand out, along with some of the benefits of starting your career in a place with a hard-charging, positive, entrepreneurial mindset.

# article_326_5-reasons-to-adopt-salesforce-as-your-investment-s

{'title': '5 Reasons to Adopt Salesforce as Your Investment Sales Team’s CRM', 'introduction': 'So, you need a CRM for your investment sales team. You want to capture leads, report on your pipeline, and ensure that you’re following up in a timely manner after meetings — this is a great thing. It means you’re about to exponentially increase your sales team’s productivity, giving them hours back in their day to do what they do best: set and hold meetings with qualified buyers. However, deciding on a CRM can also be overwhelming, since there is no shortage of software to choose from. Some key considerations to make throughout this process should include your firm’s size and budget, among others. And while we aren’t here to choose for you, we can say unequivocally that Salesforce has worked best for the Dakota team over the last fifteen years. Since 2006, Dakota has raised over $40 billion, and has used Salesforce CRM throughout that time. We’ve empowered our sales team to make entering meetings, meeting notes, and creating reports part of their day to day sales process, so that no one is ever left in the dark on what activities they’ve been doing. We know that no CRM is one-size-fits-all, but in this article, we’re going to highlight five of the key benefits that come from adopting Salesforce as your CRM. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear understanding of the value of the platform, and whether or not it’s a fit for your team. 1. Robust reporting allows for quick and easy follow-up Reporting and following up are key to closing business. They also go hand in hand. If you’re in investment sales, you already know that nothing is possible without a meeting, but if you aren’t effectively following up after you hold that meeting, you’re leaving money and opportunities on the table. Salesforce allows you to create simple, easy to use reports to track and share your team’s progress. You can also run reports to see where your opportunities are, how well you’re interacting with leads and customers, trends in your sales and customer service efforts, and more. 2. Salesforce allows for proactive customer interactions If a sales team has the knowledge of what interests a particular customer or prospect the most, they can meet that person’s needs, build a relationship, and solve problems more quickly and proactively. This can also be a huge advantage for a customer success team. Salesforce does not make you dig for information, rather it equips you with the knowledge and data you have, so a salesperson or customer success manager can get right down to what matters most. This saves everyone time and makes your potential and current customers feel understood. 3. Ability to sync data across platforms and applications Salesforce’s ability to sync across almost any other platform or application your sales team uses is one of its biggest advantages. We’re all working out of multiple systems, apps, and email accounts every day, and it can be hard to keep things organized. More than that, without the ability to sync between calendars and Salesforce, sales teams are forced to do double data entry, which takes away valuable time they could be selling and setting meetings. With Salesforce, you can eliminate this double entry by syncing your other apps and accounts directly into your CRM, saving your sales team time and allowing for even deeper insights into your prospects and customers. 4. Access to integrations through the Salesforce AppExchange While it’s true that Salesforce can’t do everything, they do have a way to continue to allow you to grow your Salesforce instance: The Salesforce AppExchange. The AppExchange is a marketplace for Salesforce customers to find any applications that suit their needs. The AppExchange has over 3,000 applications available, and includes everything from increased data and analytics apps to calendar apps, and more. While other CRMs may allow you to sync across platforms, the AppExchange itself is exclusive to Salesforce. 5. Cross-team collaboration With sales teams traveling, and other team members working remotely, it’s critical that everyone in your organization is on the same page, especially as it relates to progress being made against your pipeline, and Salesforce makes that incredibly easy. Once someone logs a note, a meeting, or any other piece of data, the rest of your sales team will be able to see and run reports on it. This ensures that no one is left in the dark. Is Salesforce right for your sales team? As we said earlier, we aren’t here to tell you once and for all which CRM is right for your firm, but in short: yes. Salesforce works for almost every industry, but was originally designed for the financial space. That makes them better equipped for investment firms than almost any other platform available. If you’re looking for a better way to collaborate with your team, report on meetings, follow up with prospects effectively, and give your sales team valuable time back in their days, the answer is yes: Salesforce is probably a good fit for you.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': '5 Reasons to Adopt Salesforce as Your Investment Sales Team’s CRM', 'content': 'So, you need a CRM for your investment sales team.

# article_336_why-your-investment-sales-team-is-crm-resistant-an

{'title': 'Why Your Investment Sales Team is CRM-Resistant — And How to Change That', 'introduction': "As an investment sales person, you’re probably tired of hearing that you have to keep your CRM data updated and fresh. We know you know this, and yet, it’s still the worst part of your day. As a sales leader, you’re probably at the point of frustration, wondering why your sales team can’t accurately report on their progress and pipelines. We know these things to be true, because since 2006, Dakota has overcome many hurdles as it relates to CRM adoption. Now, using Salesforce to create a killer follow-up system is part of our company DNA. We know that our CRM is the backbone of our sales processes, and it’s part of our culture to have every part of our sales team use it effectively. But we also know it isn’t easy, and you can’t force it. If you’re reading this article, you’re probably a salesperson yourself, or a sales leader trying to encourage CRM adoption. You’re probably wondering: is the sales team the problem? Or is Salesforce the problem? We’re here to tell you that it’s probably a little bit of both — but there are ways to overcome all of those challenges. In this article, we’re going to give you an overview of why your sales team isn’t adopting a CRM the way you would like, how to ensure that they make Salesforce a key part of their sales process, as well as the most critical fields that should be maintained for sales success. By the end of the article, you’ll have a defined plan for CRM adoption across your organization. First, we’ll dive into the reasons your team might be resisting a CRM. Why isn’t your sales team adopting a CRM? While this can come down to a few contributing factors, we’ve found that a few reasons show up the most among salespeople. The answer is simple: you’re asking them to do something they aren’t inclined to — and don’t want — to do. Chances are though, you already knew that. The personality type and the activity are on the far spectrum from one another. We know this better than most, because that’s how our sales team is, too. Salespeople want to be making sales calls and following up, not entering information. Why don’t they want to do it? It boils down to a few things. 1. The CRM is full of bad and incomplete data No one wants to add more fuel to a raging fire. If your CRM isn’t being actively maintained, your sales team probably doesn't see the value in it. If they aren’t using the information within the CRM, why would they add more information to it? They won’t. You can overcome this by making an active effort to update and maintain your team’s data. Make it part of every sales person’s onboarding to train them on using the CRM. If you start building the habit from day one, they will get into a rhythm of inputting accurate, up-to-date information into your CRM. You can also hire a dedicated Salesforce Administrator to ensure that the data is fresh and clean. This has been helpful for the team at Dakota, supplementing the data the sales team works to put in at the end of every meeting each week. We know that this can feel a bit like a chicken and the egg scenario, but it comes down to the fact that you have to start somewhere. Start by tackling the date you do have, and your sales team will be all the more inclined to use and update information. 2. Data entry is a manual process This is another one that feels obvious, but you hired salespeople to do what they do best: sell. Build relationships. Close deals. Manually entering data and meeting notes at the end of a long day is probably the last thing they want to do, especially if they’re traveling and their head is spinning with next steps and follow up notes. How do you combat this? Make it easier for them to enter notes. By creating a sync between their calendars, Slack, and Salesforce, you can start to remove the manual factor of inputting data. There are plenty of great resources to help with that, which you can read about here. (Note: our own product, Dakota Paradise is on this list, along with several other helpful apps, to help you make the most informed choice.) 3. They’re only focused on getting meetings We know: this is a great problem to have. It means your sales team is performing at their best and doing everything they need to close deals and manage relationships. The only problem with this is that if they’re getting meetings without entering any information about them into a CRM, things will more than likely fall through the cracks, making those meetings a waste of time, and no one wants that. Instead, encourage the team to view the CRM as a tool at their disposal to help them set even more meetings and continue to crush their foals. You might be wondering how this is done, but the answer is simple. By entering the name, firm, date, time, and meeting type into a CRM as an activity, you’re essentially creating a sales trigger for your future self. Once you have this information entered into Salesforce, you can use it to create opportunity and activity reports, reminding yourself or your sales team to follow-up in a timely, effective manner. This creates a constant cycle of meeting and following up, without your team ever having to lift a finger. Now that you know why your sales team is CRM-resistant, we’ll get into the key information you need to make your CRM into a sales machine. How to ensure your CRM — and your sales team — is setup for sales success If you’re a sales leader, you probably want the best not only for your sales team, but for your company. And, as we already covered above, there is, essentially, a chasm between what the sales team wants to be doing and what they should be doing. The ideal situation is a blend of both, wants and shoulds. How do you get there? And why is it important for the salesperson to get information into SF? Think about what it takes to enter information into a CRM: First, you need to be seated at a laptop, or somewhere where you can use your phone easily. This is the first challenge: salespeople are mobile, they’re traveling, making calls, and don’t have the time to login to a CRM. For the most part, they’re only logging in to do admin late at night. Because they aren’t doing it in real time, and because there is no app making it easier to get information in, they don’t update the information, and it’s often lost. Full stop. Lost. It’s critical to retain that information, and therefore it’s critical that we make it easier for them to enter information. Don’t worry though, we have it boiled down to a few critical things every Salesforce instance needs for success. Here’s how to find out what works for you: Define your account and contact field “must haves” At Dakota, the fields within our CRM vary by account, contact, and meeting, but a few stay the same. These are our “must haves.” On the “Account” object, these include: Account name Account type AUM Rating (this is an optional field) Metro area Address Phone number On the “Contact” object, these include: Name Email Phone number Title A short bio Now, remember that these are the minimum number of fields that need to be filled out by our sales team. For more detail and greater success, you can (and should) add to these. And, of course, these are nothing without the activities you associate with them. We’ll get into that next. Define your meeting note “must haves” Again, ask yourself: why is it so important for the salesperson to get the basic amount of info from a salesperson into your CRM? What is key, critical information that you need to run your business? We’ve found that the following meeting details are what we need to run and maintain activity and opportunity reports for our team. When a meeting it schedule by one of our salespeople, this information includes: Who it was scheduled by Account name Name of the person you met with Location Date Time Type of meeting (first time, follow-up, etc.) Associated product Now again, remember: we’re talking about the minimum amount of information needed to be useful. After a meeting has been scheduled, it then becomes completed, and you’d like to get those call notes into the CRM. This brings us to the third piece of the puzzle… Create an opportunity after the meeting All you need to do at this point is take the information you’ve already entered and use it to create an opportunity you can use to follow-up with. This is where you go into the database, create and name the opportunity, describe what type it is, associate it with a product, select the stage and the amount for the win, and then attach a person to it with their contact information. Simple. Finally, it’s time to use your CRM to create a killer follow-up system If you’re familiar with Dakota, you already know that this is something of a motto for us. If you’re new, you’ll hear this phrase a lot. But that’s because it works, and we’ve come to swear by it. Again we’ll ask: why is it so important to enter information? This time, we’ll even give you the answer. It’s to make follow up, tracking, and evaluating the progress of your sales efforts efficient. Creating opportunities is critical because, if done right, with one click, in under five seconds, you can find exactly what you’re looking for and follow-up with that person. It’s about collecting and hardcoding information about your sales team’s activity that creates value. Here’s how: Once you have your opportunities created, use them to create a pipeline Next, sort that pipeline by stage. These reports can include anything you want including the account name, the opportunity name, AUM, product type, the individual name, email address, phone, etc. Once you have your pipeline sorted by stage, you can make it part of your day to day to keep checking on and working through it. Taking a moment every morning to quickly scan that list means the difference between getting the relationship and letting it falter, because you’re staying on top of who you should be following up with. every morning, basically every day. Once you get into a rhythm of following up and reviewing your reports consistently, you should see more and more deals moving through the pipeline. Segment the channels within your pipeline and execute against Your TAM Finally, what you want to do as you're growing is segment the channels to know how you're doing against the TAM in that channel. You can do this by creating custom opportunity reports against a particular channel or vertical. For instance, if you cover consultants, you should have an opportunity pipeline report for just consultants that separates them into small, medium, and large segments, so you know exactly where you stand. You can also create custom fields, let's say current status and next steps. This way, as you update your Salesforce with new notes and meetings, those reports will dynamically update. You can continue to scan down those opportunity reports to see where you stand and then how you should be taking sales action. This is the most efficient way, and you can apply this methodology whether you cover banks and broker-dealers, RIAs, etc. This way, you can look at things in different areas and you're chunking it into smaller, bite-sized pieces, making it very easy to follow up and penetrate that particular channel. For penetration and total addressable market, you want to be able to create individual vertical pipeline reports so you can focus on how you're doing against each one of those verticals. If you can do that you’re going to grow exponentially, simply because you're going to be able to so much more easily access information, see where you stand, and set up follow-up meetings.

The only problem with this is that if they’re getting meetings without entering any information about them into a CRM, things will more than likely fall through the cracks, making those meetings a waste of time, and no one wants that. Instead, encourage the team to view the CRM as a tool at their disposal to help them set even more meetings and continue to crush their foals. You might be wondering how this is done, but the answer is simple. By entering the name, firm, date, time, and meeting type into a CRM as an activity, you’re essentially creating a sales trigger for your future self. Once you have this information entered into Salesforce, you can use it to create opportunity and activity reports, reminding yourself or your sales team to follow-up in a timely, effective manner. This creates a constant cycle of meeting and following up, without your team ever having to lift a finger. Now that you know why your sales team is CRM-resistant, we’ll get into the key information you need to make your CRM into a sales machine. How to ensure your CRM — and your sales team — is setup for sales success If you’re a sales leader, you probably want the best not only for your sales team, but for your company. And, as we already covered above, there is, essentially, a chasm between what the sales team wants to be doing and what they should be doing. The ideal situation is a blend of both, wants and shoulds. How do you get there? And why is it important for the salesperson to get information into SF? Think about what it takes to enter information into a CRM: First, you need to be seated at a laptop, or somewhere where you can use your phone easily. This is the first challenge: salespeople are mobile, they’re traveling, making calls, and don’t have the time to login to a CRM. For the most part, they’re only logging in to do admin late at night. Because they aren’t doing it in real time, and because there is no app making it easier to get information in, they don’t update the information, and it’s often lost. Full stop. Lost. It’s critical to retain that information, and therefore it’s critical that we make it easier for them to enter information. Don’t worry though, we have it boiled down to a few critical things every Salesforce instance needs for success. Here’s how to find out what works for you: Define your account and contact field “must haves” At Dakota, the fields within our CRM vary by account, contact, and meeting, but a few stay the same. These are our “must haves.” On the “Account” object, these include: Account name Account type AUM Rating (this is an optional field) Metro area Address Phone number On the “Contact” object, these include: Name Email Phone number Title A short bio Now, remember that these are the minimum number of fields that need to be filled out by our sales team. For more detail and greater success, you can (and should) add to these. And, of course, these are nothing without the activities you associate with them. We’ll get into that next. Define your meeting note “must haves” Again, ask yourself: why is it so important for the salesperson to get the basic amount of info from a salesperson into your CRM? What is key, critical information that you need to run your business? We’ve found that the following meeting details are what we need to run and maintain activity and opportunity reports for our team. When a meeting it schedule by one of our salespeople, this information includes: Who it was scheduled by Account name Name of the person you met with Location Date Time Type of meeting (first time, follow-up, etc.) Associated product Now again, remember: we’re talking about the minimum amount of information needed to be useful. After a meeting has been scheduled, it then becomes completed, and you’d like to get those call notes into the CRM. This brings us to the third piece of the puzzle… Create an opportunity after the meeting All you need to do at this point is take the information you’ve already entered and use it to create an opportunity you can use to follow-up with. This is where you go into the database, create and name the opportunity, describe what type it is, associate it with a product, select the stage and the amount for the win, and then attach a person to it with their contact information. Simple. Finally, it’s time to use your CRM to create a killer follow-up system If you’re familiar with Dakota, you already know that this is something of a motto for us. If you’re new, you’ll hear this phrase a lot. But that’s because it works, and we’ve come to swear by it. Again we’ll ask: why is it so important to enter information? This time, we’ll even give you the answer. It’s to make follow up, tracking, and evaluating the progress of your sales efforts efficient. Creating opportunities is critical because, if done right, with one click, in under five seconds, you can find exactly what you’re looking for and follow-up with that person. It’s about collecting and hardcoding information about your sales team’s activity that creates value. Here’s how: Once you have your opportunities created, use them to create a pipeline Next, sort that pipeline by stage. These reports can include anything you want including the account name, the opportunity name, AUM, product type, the individual name, email address, phone, etc. Once you have your pipeline sorted by stage, you can make it part of your day to day to keep checking on and working through it. Taking a moment every morning to quickly scan that list means the difference between getting the relationship and letting it falter, because you’re staying on top of who you should be following up with. every morning, basically every day. Once you get into a rhythm of following up and reviewing your reports consistently, you should see more and more deals moving through the pipeline. Segment the channels within your pipeline and execute against Your TAM Finally, what you want to do as you're growing is segment the channels to know how you're doing against the TAM in that channel. You can do this by creating custom opportunity reports against a particular channel or vertical. For instance, if you cover consultants, you should have an opportunity pipeline report for just consultants that separates them into small, medium, and large segments, so you know exactly where you stand. You can also create custom fields, let's say current status and next steps. This way, as you update your Salesforce with new notes and meetings, those reports will dynamically update. You can continue to scan down those opportunity reports to see where you stand and then how you should be taking sales action. This is the most efficient way, and you can apply this methodology whether you cover banks and broker-dealers, RIAs, etc. This way, you can look at things in different areas and you're chunking it into smaller, bite-sized pieces, making it very easy to follow up and penetrate that particular channel. For penetration and total addressable market, you want to be able to create individual vertical pipeline reports so you can focus on how you're doing against each one of those verticals. If you can do that you’re going to grow exponentially, simply because you're going to be able to so much more easily access information, see where you stand, and set up follow-up meetings.

{'title': 'Top 5 Reasons the Golden Field is Essential for Investment Sales Professionals', 'introduction': 'Imagine this: you log into Salesforce, run a quick report on all the RIAs in Boston, and instantly see where you stand with each one. No guesswork, no manual filtering – just a clear view of your position with every key account. This is CRM utopia. But here’s the thing: you don’t have to imagine it. This feature exists, and setting it up is simpler than you’d think. We call it the golden field – a powerful tool within your Salesforce instance that gives you that single, comprehensive snapshot you’ve been looking for.

By the end of this, you’ll have an understanding of why this feature is so critical to fundraisers. Golden Field in Salesforce The golden field in Salesforce is a specialized data field designed to be the ultimate “source of truth” for key account information.

It’s a go-to reference point within Salesforce, consolidating information from various stages of the sales cycle, geographic regions, or client segments to provide quick, reliable insights.

Purposely built for investment sales professionals, the golden field brings together everything you need to navigate complex accounts, prioritize outreach, and drive growth.

Effective Prioritization for Strategic Outreach The golden field categorizes accounts by sales cycle stage, enabling you and your sales team to plan strategically and allocate resources where they’ll have the greatest impact.

# article_312_the-top-10-owners-of-tips-etfs-in-2022

{'title': 'The Top 10 Owners of TIPS ETFs in 2022', 'introduction': 'Since the beginning of quantitative easing by global central banks, one of the major goals was to get reflation/inflation of wages, goods, and services across the economy. In order to be protected from the expected inflation to come, many allocators had added inflation exposure via TIPS and other similar inflation vehicles, and have done so since 2008, only to see asset price inflation, but not underlying inflation occur. As a result, many allocators and central banks were left scratching their heads: there was so much liquidity, but no inflation for over a decade. Enter a global pandemic, and bam, we’ve since found that inflation. Now, global supply chain disruptions, combined with the “great resignation” and other pandemic factors impacting employment, we’re seeing the inflation that central banks so desperately wanted. This inflation means that investors quickly needed to gain exposure to rising inflation/CPI in their portfolios. One of the most direct ways is by allocating to TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities). TIPS are linked to CPI, which adjusts and compensates bond holders for that inflation, and they are the most direct inflation hedge, as TIPS’ principal is linked to the CPI-U (Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers). In this article, we’re outlining the top 10 owners of TIPS ETFs. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear understanding of the landscape. 1.

In order to be protected from the expected inflation to come, many allocators had added inflation exposure via TIPS and other similar inflation vehicles, and have done so since 2008, only to see asset price inflation, but not underlying inflation occur. As a result, many allocators and central banks were left scratching their heads: there was so much liquidity, but no inflation for over a decade. Enter a global pandemic, and bam, we’ve since found that inflation. Now, global supply chain disruptions, combined with the “great resignation” and other pandemic factors impacting employment, we’re seeing the inflation that central banks so desperately wanted. This inflation means that investors quickly needed to gain exposure to rising inflation/CPI in their portfolios. One of the most direct ways is by allocating to TIPS (Treasury Inflation Protected Securities). TIPS are linked to CPI, which adjusts and compensates bond holders for that inflation, and they are the most direct inflation hedge, as TIPS’ principal is linked to the CPI-U (Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers). In this article, we’re outlining the top 10 owners of TIPS ETFs. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear understanding of the landscape. 1.
