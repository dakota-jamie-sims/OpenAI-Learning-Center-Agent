{'title': 'The 10 Most Frequently Asked Questions About Dakota Marketplace', 'introduction': "The greatest challenge a fundraiser faces day in and day out is knowing who to call on and being able to find accurate, up-to-date information for them to close their deals. At Dakota we face the same challenge as we're fundraisers, just like you. In solution we decided to create the most accurate and up-to-date database in the industry, Dakota Marketplace. Our platform brings a different approach to the table since our platform is built by fundraisers for fundraisers. In this article we will offer a brief overview of our firm Dakota and answer the most frequently asked questions we get from fundraisers, like yourselves, about Dakota Marketplace.

What is Dakota Marketplace? Dakota Marketplace is the industry's only investment sales database built, used, and updated by a team of fundraisers.

How is this different from other databases I already subscribe to? We are the only database provider that actually raises capital for a living, just like you. This is extremely important because we too understand the daily pain you go through dealing with stale and outdated information. Additionally, our Customer Success and Membership Services team is above any other competitor in this industry. 5. Does the data integrate with other CRMs? Currently, Dakota Marketplace has a Salesforce integration called the Dakota Marketplace for Salesforce App that connects our Marketplace data and brings it directly into your Salesforce. If you don't have Salesforce we offer two alternative options. Either access our API, or we have a flat-file option available. 6. How do you gather and update your data? We collect and keep the information updated in a variety of different ways. First and foremost, our CRM was built over the past 15 years by our investment sales team as they've raised over $40 billion across all channels.

We've also added about 1,200 searches, RFPs, and mandates. Again, all predominantly within that institutional channel. 8. How is your international coverage? As of right now, our platform is primarily geared towards LP content within the US and Canadian markets. However, we are working on getting towards a more global coverage scale. For now, think of our platform as full coverage across both the US and Canadian markets. 9. What additional features are offered in Dakota Marketplace?

# article_082_private-credit-allocations-recommended-by-the-top

{'title': 'Private Credit Allocations Recommended by The Top Consultants in Q3 2024', 'introduction': "In the third quarter of this year, private credit continued to be a focal point for institutional investors, with a range of significant commitments guided by consultants across the U.S. public pension and retirement systems. These recommendations reflect the growing demand for alternative credit strategies, which have become an essential component of portfolio diversification amid economic uncertainty. Consultants such as RVK, Verus, Cambridge Associates, and others advised their clients to allocate substantial capital into credit funds spanning direct lending, opportunistic credit, and distressed debt. RVK, for instance, recommended over $1.3 billion in private credit investments, with New York State Common Retirement Fund leading the way with a $400 million commitment to the Empire Credit Co-Investment Fund.

Verus oversaw allocations exceeding $550 million, highlighting Atalaya Special Opportunities Fund IX and Carlyle Direct Lending SMA, while Cambridge directed over $500 million into opportunities such as Atalaya and Primary Wave Music IP Fund 4.

{'title': 'Investment Mandates: What They are and How to Stay Updated on Them', 'introduction': "If you’re in the investment sales business, then you likely already know that staying up-to-date on a rapidly changing industry can feel like a constant, up-hill battle. There are plenty of resources for you to do just that, everything from publications to weekly calls that enable you to keep your finger on the pulse of new searches, RFPs, and job changes within the industry. At Dakota, it’s our goal to help our peers and colleagues do just that. We’ve raised over $40 billion since 2006, and while it wasn’t always easy, we made it one of our core values to always be uncovering “the new.” This means our sales team is always doing everything they can to stay updated on things like searches. In this article, we’re going to explain what investment mandates are, why they’re important, and three services you can use to stay up-to-date on the most recent investment mandates. By the end of the article, you’ll have a better idea of what your options are, and how to move forward. What is an institutional investment mandate? An investment mandate is essentially your rulebook for how assets should be invested. Not only do these rules serve you, but they help investment managers make proper decisions. Think of each fund having a set of instructions to help manage a specific portfolio or fund. Essentially, they're a framework for transparency among all involved parties and help set expectations. Institutional investment mandates play a big role in the control of pooled funds. They may include rules on: Priorities and goals Benchmarks Acceptable levels of risk Types of funds to either be used or avoided Any other rules for how assets should be managed Why are investment mandates important? Anyone who’s considering investing their money through a mutual fund, ETF, or other form of managed fund is going to want to understand said fund’s investment mandate. By understanding the mandate, you’ll be able to invest your money wisely. It’s essential to stay up-to-date with these mandates. Pension funds are a huge contributor to capital for many private equity, private credit, private real estate, private infrastructure, equities, and fixed income mandates. Naturally, you’re going to need to be on top of these so you can be the first to participate in them. How do you keep up-to-date with investment mandates? In this section we’re providing three solutions to keep up with institutional investment mandates.  You’ll be able make an informed decision on which is best for you and your firm. 1.

MandateWire provides money managers with investment intelligence on RFPs, planned allocations and institutional asset flows in Europe, North America, APAC and India, The Middle East & Africa.

# article_094_dakota-fund-tracker-week-of-8-26-2024

{'title': 'Dakota Fund Tracker | Week of 8-26-2024', 'introduction': 'The "New Funds Tracker" blog is your weekly roundup of newly launched funds in the market, based on Form D filings. This blog delivers critical insights into the latest trends within the investment landscape, offering a comprehensive overview of where capital is flowing and which sectors are gaining momentum. As of September 6th, 73 new funds have been launched last week, according to Form D filings in Dakota Marketplace. From our private funds data, there are currently 400 funds fundraising in the market across various product structures. In this article, we’ll give you a breakdown overview of these 73 new funds, and a highlight into trends across asset classes and the industry. Number of New Funds This past week, we tracked the launch of new funds across a variety of asset classes, highlighting the continuous momentum in fundraising activity. Here\'s a breakdown of the new funds by asset class: In the latest round of fund launches, private equity remains a strong player, with nearly 20 new funds emerging. Growth equity and co-investments are popular strategies, alongside sector-specific funds in areas like healthcare and technology. Venture capital is also active, with over a dozen early-stage funds and in the technology sector. Private real estate saw around 15 new funds, with opportunistic real estate strategies leading, while real estate debt funds also contributed to the mix across the residential and commercial sectors. Private credit launched a handful of funds, with direct lending and opportunistic strategies, along with structured credit strategies. Hedge funds are diversifying, with a few focused on global macro and long/short equity strategies. Infrastructure funds are more selective, with a couple of new entrants in energy and oil & gas. Additionally, there’s some activity in emerging market and global equities, with a few Form D filings for each. This reflects the diversity of strategies being pursued in the current market, as investors explore both traditional and niche approaches to capital deployment. Asset Class Trends Private Equity: Private Equity is leading the new fund launches. This week’s activity includes a range of funds targeting growth equity and co-investment opportunities, particularly in sectors such as technology and telecommunications. For example, Light Street Capital launched two co-investment private equity funds focusing on these areas, reflecting continued investor interest in digital innovation. Private Credit: Another strong performer, with direct lending gaining significant traction. Ares Capital Corporation launched its Ares Global Structured Solutions LP fund, underscoring the growing demand for structured credit and mid-market lending solutions. Private Real Estate: Private Real Estate funds are also showing significant activity, with 15 new funds launched this past week. These funds are primarily focused on Commercial Real Estate and multifamily housing projects, particularly in North America and Europe. With the real estate market still recovering from pandemic disruptions, investors are increasingly targeting stabilized assets in major metropolitan areas, as well as value-add opportunities in secondary markets. Industry Trends Healthcare & Industrial: Both sectors continue to attract substantial capital, especially in the Private Equity space. Many new funds, such as those launched by Ares Capital Corporation, are targeting these sectors, emphasizing their perceived resilience and long-term growth potential. Technology & Telecommunications: As digital transformation drives new opportunities, this sector remains a key focus for many private equity funds. Notably, Light Street Capital launched two new co-investment funds targeting the media, technology, and telecommunications sectors, highlighting the sector\'s appeal. Consumer: Consumer-facing industries are also being actively pursued, particularly in funds with a multi-industry approach. The inclusion of Consumer among targeted industries reflects the sector\'s recovery and evolving consumer behavior in a post-pandemic world. Geographic Distribution The funds launched this week are largely targeting a global audience, with a specific emphasis on North America, Europe, and Asia. This broad geographical scope suggests that investors are continuing to diversify across both developed and emerging markets, positioning themselves for long-term growth in multiple regions. The New Funds Tracker blog provides a snapshot of the latest trends shaping the investment landscape. With strong interest in Private Equity and Private Credit, particularly in resilient industries like Healthcare and Technology, this week’s fund launches underscore the dynamic and diverse strategies investors are employing.

# article_167_5-benefits-to-video-marketing-for-investment-firms

{'title': '5 Benefits to Video Marketing for Investment Firms', 'introduction': "In the digital marketing arena, video marketing emerges as a beacon of engagement and effectiveness. This isn't just another trend; it's a fundamental shift in how investment firms can connect with their audience. From small startups to global giants, the pivot towards video content is reshaping marketing strategies worldwide, driven by its unparalleled ability to captivate, inform, and persuade. Why does video stand out in a sea of digital content? The answer lies in its intrinsic power to tell stories that resonate, educate, and inspire. Video marketing isn't merely about promoting a product or service; it's about crafting a story about your brand that weaves into the daily lives of your audience. This connection is rooted in the five key benefits that video brings to the table: broader reach and accessibility, cost-effectiveness, increased engagement, actionable data and analytics, and the potential for deep customization and personalization. As we delve deeper into these benefits, it becomes clear why video marketing is not just an option but a necessity for those looking to forge meaningful connections and drive success in today’s digital landscape. In this article, we are discussing the five benefits to digital video marketing. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of these benefits and how to go about incorporating them into your business. 1. Broader reach and accessibility Video marketing transcends barriers, offering businesses unparalleled global reach and accessibility. Traditional marketing efforts are often limited by location and high distribution costs, but video content eliminates these constraints, allowing instant worldwide sharing. This digital medium's inherent shareability, especially through social media, websites, and email campaigns, can propel content to viral status, significantly expanding its audience. The universal accessibility of video content - available anytime, anywhere, and on any device - enhances brand visibility and engagement, fostering a deeper connection with diverse audiences. Most importantly, it helps bring your brand’s story to life so your audience can comprehend in an easy way. This is why we created Dakota Studios, a film and production studio in the heart of downtown Philadelphia. By integrating into the daily digital experience of consumers, video marketing maintains a constant brand presence, overcoming the limitations of time zones and physical distance, and cultivating a global community around a brand. 2. Cost-effectiveness The cost-effectiveness of digital marketing, particularly in video content, offers a significant financial advantage over traditional marketing methods. With lower production and distribution costs, digital formats allow businesses of all sizes to produce high-quality content affordably. This efficiency enables frequent updates and repurposing across multiple platforms, ensuring materials remain current without incurring additional costs. The effectiveness of video content is second to none. We have said time and time again in our Rainmaker Masterclass that a perfect example of leveraging your time as an investment sales professional is hosting a quarterly webinar. Once you record this, you’re able to chop this up into small clips, get a transcript, get a summary document and send all four of these marketing materials to clients and prospects. The initial cost of recording a webinar may seem intimidating, but in the end it pays out to the amount of marketing collateral you’ll have to send to people. 3. Increased awareness and engagement Increased awareness and engagement are central to the efficacy of digital marketing, with video content playing a pivotal role in amplifying these elements. By incorporating interactive features like clickable links, embedded videos, and dynamic animations, digital collateral transforms from static to dynamic, engaging users on a deeper level. These interactive components not only captivate the audience's attention but also encourage active participation, significantly boosting both awareness and engagement. This heightened interaction fosters a more profound connection between the brand and its audience, ensuring that the message not only reaches a wider audience but also resonates more meaningfully. As a result, brands leveraging these interactive digital strategies can expect enhanced visibility and a more engaged audience, driving forward their marketing objectives with greater impact. Continuing on with the webinar example for investment firms, once you have this marketing collateral created you are now able to send four different things to clients and prospects. If you do this quarterly, this is a minimum of 4 times a year you’ll be hitting their inbox. In addition, if you are sending email invitations to these webinars, an email with the replay, and an email with follow up collateral, this is an additional 3 to 4 emails per quarter. Even though not everyone will respond or engage with your email, they’re seeing your firm and your brand. The more consistent you are, the more they will recognize your name which can put you ahead of the competition. 4. Data and analytics The integration of data and analytics represents a transformative shift in how marketing effectiveness is measured and optimized. Through the detailed tracking of user interactions, businesses gain access to a treasure trove of data that offers insights into viewer behavior, preferences, and engagement levels. This information is invaluable, not only for assessing the immediate impact of marketing efforts but also for refining and enhancing future campaigns. By analyzing metrics such as click-through rates, time spent on content, and conversion rates, marketers can identify what resonates with their audience and what doesn’t. This level of insight allows for the optimization of marketing strategies in real-time, ensuring that resources are allocated to the most effective channels and approaches. Furthermore, data-driven analytics enable a deeper understanding of customer journeys, highlighting opportunities for personalization and targeted messaging. Most importantly, if a comprehensive analysis is completed, businesses are able to see what’s working and what’s not working for them. This allows them to craft more compelling and relevant content, leading to improved engagement and conversion rates. In essence, the use of data and analytics in digital marketing not only quantifies success but also provides the roadmap for achieving it, making it an indispensable tool for any marketing strategy aiming for measurable impact and continuous improvement. 5. Customization and personalization Customization and personalization in digital marketing represent a significant leap forward in how businesses connect with diverse audience segments. The ability to tailor marketing materials to specific areas of interest is one of the most compelling advantages of digital formats. This level of customization ensures that messages are not just seen but are also meaningful to the end buyer. As stated above, through the strategic use of data analytics investment firms can gain deep insights into their target audience’s preferences and habits. This information allows for the creation of highly targeted content that speaks directly to individual needs and desires. Whether it's personalized email campaigns, tailored video messages, or customized social media content, the goal is the same: to make each member of the audience feel uniquely understood and valued. Putting it together It's evident that video content is not merely an option but a cornerstone of modern marketing strategies for investment firms. This tool has the unmatched capability to not only span across global audiences with ease, but also to resonate deeply on an individual level fostering a connection that transcends the superficial layers of traditional marketing techniques. By leveraging the detailed insights provided by data analytics, firms can tailor their messages to the heartbeat of their audience's interests and needs, ensuring that every piece of content not only reaches its target but also strikes a chord. In a world where attention is the currency, video marketing offers a return on investment that's rich with the potential for conversion, loyalty, and brand advocacy. For businesses ready to harness the full spectrum of video marketing's benefits, the path ahead is ripe with opportunities for growth, innovation, and connection. The journey of transforming viewers into advocates, leads into customers, and content into conversions is just a play button away. Embracing video marketing is not just adapting to a trend; it's investing in a strategy that will define the success of digital marketing endeavors in the years to come.

# article_040_the-magic-of-25-asks-a-day-why-consistency-and-rej

{'title': 'The Magic of 25 Asks a Day: Why Consistency (and Rejection) Will Set You Free', 'introduction': 'If you’re in investment sales, you already know the truth: Nobody loves cold outreach. Sure, we love the idea of meeting new people, making connections, and bringing in the big bucks… …but hearing “no thanks” (or worse, crickets) can make even the most confident salesperson want to hide under their desk. So how do we overcome this harsh reality and actually build momentum? With one simple, consistent practice: 25 Asks a Day. Yep, it sounds basic. But this rule is powerful. Why 25, you ask? Because it’s enough to build meaningful traction in your pipeline without turning your daily outreach into a painful endurance test. By embracing 25 asks a day, done with just the right approach, you’re going to build momentum, conquer your dread of rejection, and set yourself up for long-term success. And the secret? Do it day after day, city after city, with the right email that gets straight to the point. In this article, we are reviewing the importance of consistency with 25 Asks a Day. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of why cold outreach is needed to continue performing your job. New call-to-action The Real Issue: Rejection First, let’s address the elephant in the room. We all know why people resist cold outreach: nobody likes rejection. People don’t want to be ignored or hear “no.” And if you’ve ever spent serious time crafting an email – perfecting the subject line, getting every word just right – only for it to disappear into someone’s inbox forever, you know exactly how frustrating it can be. But here’s the reality: rejection isn’t your enemy. It’s just part of the game. I get it; cold outreach isn’t easy, and it probably never will be. But 25 asks a day helps us take the sting out of each “no.” It’s a volume game, where even the ghostings and flat-out rejections are paving the way for an eventual “yes.” When you’re consistent, rejection doesn’t feel so personal; it’s just a necessary step toward getting where you want to go. And hey, if you feel like you’re the only one hearing “no” out there, trust me – you’re not. The “no’s” are just stepping stones to the win. The Solution: Consistency Now, here’s the thing: if you’re only asking sporadically, every rejection feels like a body blow. Suddenly, it’s all “What did I say wrong?” or “Should I change my approach?” But once you commit to 25 asks every single day, things change. One “no” doesn’t matter nearly as much because you’ve got 24 other asks going, and you know tomorrow you’ll have 25 more. Consistency is more than just doing the work; it’s about creating unstoppable momentum and building real relationships. When I talk about city scheduling on Rainmaker Live!, I’m not kidding. With five cities in rotation on your calendar, sending out those 25 asks keeps you on track and gives each day’s work a clear purpose. Today, you’re focused on New York; tomorrow, Chicago; after that, San Francisco. This steady rhythm keeps you productive and, most importantly, helps you create a network over time. Here’s the magic of this consistency: each ask isn’t just about getting a yes or no today. It’s about building familiarity so that when your prospect is ready to move, they think of you. Every outreach, even if it’s ignored now, is strengthening name recognition. Over time, even people who don’t respond start to know who you are, what your firm stands for, and what value you bring. It’s not transactional; it’s about building long-term value. That’s what we do at Dakota. Every ask you send out is one more step in building a true network. So stick to it and stay in front of people consistently. When the timing aligns, you’re the one they’ll reach out to because you’re already in their mind. New call-to-action Crafting the Perfect Email Just because you’re sending 25 emails a day doesn’t mean they can be thrown together. Quality matters, and there’s a structure to crafting emails that get responses. Here’s my go-to approach for writing emails that hit the mark: A Clear Subject Line: Get straight to the point. Go with “Meeting Request – November 15 at 11 AM” instead of something generic like “Quick Question”. Your subject line should make them want to open it. 2-3 Sentences to Pack a Punch: Let’s face it: nobody wants to read a lengthy email talking about you, your firm, and your strategy. Keep it short and to the point where they feel like they can’t say no to you. This isn’t the time for a sales pitch or a deep dive into your firm’s philosophy. Keep it short. “I think our investment strategy aligns with your mid-cap focus, and I’d love to discuss our approach.” Specific Call to Action: Here’s a pro tip – be direct. “Are you available for a meeting on November 15 at 11 AM?” Don’t leave it open-ended, and make it easy for them to say yes or no. This formula works because it’s respectful, professional, and easy to read. When people open your email, they see exactly what you’re asking, and they can decide quickly. Trust me, clarity is respected, and it’s why people respond. City Scheduling: Adding Purpose to Your Asks If 25 asks a day are the foundation, then city scheduling is the structure that holds it all together. Instead of firing off emails randomly, city scheduling is about being purposeful in your outreach. Let’s say you’re focused on Boston today, Dallas tomorrow, and Miami the next. You’re not only putting in the asks; you’re making it easy to follow up in an organized way, and you’re setting yourself up for efficient travel when it’s time to meet face-to-face. At Dakota we call this “purposeful asks” for a reason. When each day’s 25 asks are focused on a specific place, it’s easier to stay on top of your pipeline and keep everything moving. You’re building a rhythm that’s efficient, intentional, and designed to keep you productive without burning out. Choose a City, and Start Sending Your 25 Asks If you want lasting results in this business, start with 25 asks a day. Stick to it, make every ask meaningful, and let rejection lose its sting. By sticking to this routine, you’re doing more than setting meetings – you’re building a network, a pipeline, and a career that lasts. Cold outreach may never be glamorous, but with 25 asks a day, it’s doable. And the real win? You’re building a pipeline as steady and reliable as you are. And trust me – when you keep showing up, day in and day out, success is inevitable.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'The Magic of 25 Asks a Day: Why Consistency (and Rejection) Will Set You Free', 'content': 'If you’re in investment sales, you already know the truth: Nobody loves cold outreach.

Keep it short. “I think our investment strategy aligns with your mid-cap focus, and I’d love to discuss our approach.” Specific Call to Action: Here’s a pro tip – be direct. “Are you available for a meeting on November 15 at 11 AM?” Don’t leave it open-ended, and make it easy for them to say yes or no. This formula works because it’s respectful, professional, and easy to read. When people open your email, they see exactly what you’re asking, and they can decide quickly. Trust me, clarity is respected, and it’s why people respond. City Scheduling: Adding Purpose to Your Asks If 25 asks a day are the foundation, then city scheduling is the structure that holds it all together. Instead of firing off emails randomly, city scheduling is about being purposeful in your outreach. Let’s say you’re focused on Boston today, Dallas tomorrow, and Miami the next. You’re not only putting in the asks; you’re making it easy to follow up in an organized way, and you’re setting yourself up for efficient travel when it’s time to meet face-to-face. At Dakota we call this “purposeful asks” for a reason. When each day’s 25 asks are focused on a specific place, it’s easier to stay on top of your pipeline and keep everything moving. You’re building a rhythm that’s efficient, intentional, and designed to keep you productive without burning out. Choose a City, and Start Sending Your 25 Asks If you want lasting results in this business, start with 25 asks a day. Stick to it, make every ask meaningful, and let rejection lose its sting. By sticking to this routine, you’re doing more than setting meetings – you’re building a network, a pipeline, and a career that lasts. Cold outreach may never be glamorous, but with 25 asks a day, it’s doable. And the real win? You’re building a pipeline as steady and reliable as you are. And trust me – when you keep showing up, day in and day out, success is inevitable.', 'bullet_points': [], 'subsections': []}], 'key_takeaways': [], 'faqs': []}

# article_075_emerging-manager-growth-show-discussion-w-gui-cost

{'title': 'Emerging Manager Growth Show Discussion w/ Gui Costin + Tim Dolan', 'introduction': 'Emerging managers often face the challenge of growing their businesses on limited budgets, and Dakota’s Emerging Manager Growth Show is designed specifically to help. Hosted by Dakota’s CEO and Founder, Gui Costin, the show offers practical advice on how managers can do more with less. Each episode focuses on a different institutional channel such as RIAs, pension funds, family offices, banks and broker-dealers or consultants, and provides actionable tips on scaling, best practices, and navigating industry trends. The goal is to equip emerging managers with the tools needed to thrive in a competitive landscape. This past September, the Emerging Manager Growth Show focused on the RIA Channel with Gui Costin and Tim Dolan sharing their insights on why the RIA space is ideal for emerging managers. They offer strategies for successful outreach, including the importance of consistency, leveraging webinars, and capitalizing on RIAs of all sizes. In this article, we will cover the key takeaways from September\'s Emerging Manager Growth Show. By the end of this, you’ll have actionable tips to help you navigate the RIA space and grow your business. Key Takeaways 1. RIAs are Prime for Emerging Managers The RIA space presents a significant opportunity for emerging managers. RIAs are always looking for unique investment strategies to differentiate their portfolios, attract clients, and retain their current client base. Unlike institutional investors, which often require a long track record and substantial assets under management, RIAs tend to be more open to working with newer and smaller managers. This makes the RIA space an attractive market for emerging managers looking to make their mark. 2. Discretion and Flexibility in the RIA Space A key advantage of RIAs is their discretionary authority, which allows them to allocate capital quickly and efficiently. RIAs often don’t need approval from large committees, which means they can act faster than institutional investors. They can also invest in managers who may not meet the track record or asset thresholds typically required by other channels. This flexibility is a game-changer for emerging managers who are in the early stages of growth. 3. Consistent Outreach is Key Success in the RIA space requires consistency and discipline. Emerging managers should adopt a structured approach to outreach, such as city scheduling, where they target five cities at a time and book multiple meetings throughout the day. It’s essential to send simple, direct emails and maintain a consistent outreach schedule. This disciplined approach helps managers build relationships over time, even when initial responses are slow. 4. Small RIAs Offer Big Opportunities Smaller RIAs can be just as valuable as their larger counterparts, especially given the high level of mergers and acquisitions in the RIA space. Many smaller RIAs are being acquired by larger firms, and building relationships with them early on can lead to much larger opportunities down the line. If a small RIA that you work with is acquired by a larger firm, you could suddenly have a relationship with a much bigger player in the industry. 5. Quarterly Webinars are a Must-Do Quarterly webinars are one of the most efficient ways for emerging managers to stay connected with clients and prospects. Webinars provide a platform to share performance updates, discuss the outlook for upcoming quarters, and demonstrate the manager’s investment strategy. For emerging managers, who may not yet have the brand recognition of larger firms, webinars are a free and effective way to build awareness and engagement. 6. Networking Events: A Powerful Tool Hosting or co-hosting networking events, such as luncheons or cocktail parties, is an excellent way to connect with RIAs in a more personal setting. These events help build relationships face-to-face, which can be invaluable when you’re trying to stand out in a crowded market. Even if turnout is small initially, consistency is key. Hosting regular events will eventually create buzz and increase attendance, making your firm the go-to for local industry gatherings. 7. Ask the Tough Questions in Meetings At the end of every meeting, it’s crucial to ask two key questions to assess where you stand with the RIA: “Do you see this strategy fitting within your asset allocation mix?” “Do you anticipate doing a search in the next 12 months in this asset class?” These questions provide immediate clarity on whether there is a real opportunity. If the answers are positive, you can dive deeper into the timeline and specifics. This saves time and avoids unnecessary follow-up when there’s no immediate fit. 8. Do More with Less: Efficiency Tools Emerging managers often have to make the most of limited resources, and efficiency tools like city scheduling and quarterly webinars are essential for maximizing reach. These strategies help managers maintain regular contact with RIAs without requiring a large marketing budget. When applied consistently, these tools can yield significant results and build strong relationships over time. 9. Money is in Motion Across All Channels Despite market challenges, there is "money in motion" across all channels, including RIAs. Private equity and private credit strategies are especially topical right now. Emerging managers should take advantage of this momentum by staying proactive with outreach, engaging RIAs, and consistently presenting new ideas to potential investors. 10. The Importance of a Strong Database A comprehensive database, like Dakota Marketplace, is a valuable resource for emerging managers targeting the RIA space. With detailed information on over 14,000 RIAs, managers can focus their outreach on specific segments based on size, broker-dealer affiliation, or custodial platforms. Having access to this kind of data allows for more targeted and effective engagement, which can accelerate success in the RIA market. Start Calling on RIAs In conclusion, the RIA space presents a significant opportunity for emerging managers to build and grow their businesses. By focusing on consistent outreach, leveraging efficient tools like city scheduling and quarterly webinars, and cultivating relationships with both small and large RIAs, managers can successfully navigate this space. The advice shared in September\'s Emerging Manager Growth Show emphasizes the importance of persistence and strategic targeting, providing a clear roadmap for managers looking to raise capital and expand their reach. With the right approach, RIAs can be a catalyst for long-term growth.

# article_392_in-house-vs-outsourced-data-management-which-is-ri

{'title': 'In-house vs. Outsourced Data Management: Which is Right for You?', 'introduction': "Did you know that 65% of people's job titles change every year? That number is staggering, but if you’re an investment sales professional, it probably doesn't come as too much of a surprise to you. One of the hardest parts of any sales person’s job is calling on the right people and setting up meetings. Your job is only made harder when you’re working with outdated data, showing people who have changed jobs, titles, and phone numbers since you last interacted with them. A CRM is a powerful tool, but it’s only as good as the data within it. So, the question becomes, how do you best maintain your data? You have a couple of options. Do you attempt to do it yourself, either building it into your sales team’s process or by hiring a database administrator? Or, do you outsource it by hiring a third party? It all depends on the needs of your team. Because Dakota is a database provider, we know the ins and outs of the space, and just how much time goes into ensuring everything is as updated as possible. But we know what you might be thinking: of course we’ll tell you that the best way forward is a third party, it’s what we do, after all. But that’s not the case; we know that not every company has the same size data, team, or budget. In this article, we’ll break down the pros and cons of keeping your data in-house versus hiring an outside, third party to keep up with it for you. By the end of this post, you’ll be able to decide which is best for your team, so that your data is as up to date as possible. Third party data maintenance options When it comes to third parties, you can go in a few different ways. You can get your data directly from an outside source (database subscription) and import it into your CRM or use an outsourced database administrator. A database subscription: You pay a yearly subscription fee in exchange for access to a database of accounts and contacts within the investment industry. These are specialized to fit the needs of the industry, and come in a variety of sizes, from hundreds of thousands of accounts and contacts, to a more scaled down list. Depending on the database your team chooses, you still might need to verify the data to ensure accuracy. A database administration system: These are software options that will help ensure that your data is as up to date as possible. These types of systems, offered by companies like Oracle, SentryOne, and Redgate, are often designed to complement your data team, rather than act as a single solution to data upkeep. Next, we’ll dive into the pros and cons of third party data management. The benefits of third party data management Greater efficiency: At the end of the day, outsourcing your data and data management is going to save you and your team time. Instead of hunting for information on who to call, it’s already at your fingertips and ready to use. This allows your sales team to get to work making calls and setting meetings, which leads to more deals closed. Access to large quantities of data: A third party database is able to pull a large amount of data in a short amount of time. This means your team will have access to a ton of information without spending hours of time researching it first. Databases are especially beneficial for large projects, or for when a company is trying to get a sense of a new industry or market. The drawbacks of third party data management Your data can get stale: If you’re getting your data from a third party source or relying strictly on the industry, your data can get stale, leading to outdated contact information. Instead you need to find and update contact information yourself, or update and build relationships with people, allowing you to keep it updated with minimal effort. The data isn’t always accurate: If you’re getting data from a third party, there is no guarantee that it will be one hundred percent correct. This could mean the need for human intervention and double checking data received, or working with the third party database administration system to oversee that it is correct. In-house data management The benefits of in-house data management Real-time updates: Having a dedicated person or team within your organization means having a dedicated resource to focus on cleaning up your data, so it will always be as accurate as possible. With a third party or software, there could be delays, especially if you are working with a large data set. In an industry where data can get stale very quickly, this can be a major downside that may sway you to keep things in-house. Dedication and trust: Having someone who understands the needs and goals of your business and can be focused on them adds a layer of trust to the process that may not exist with third party resources. The drawbacks of in-house data management It can be time consuming: It is a very time-intensive process to go through all of your data each day and ensure that it’s updated and accurate. Depending on the size of your data team, you might not be able to update as much information in bulk as a third party source or system would. So, which is right for you? This ultimately depends how specialized you and your company are. If you’re looking for a broad amount of accounts and contacts, then a third party data source would be better. If you’re more specialized in a specific channel, (RIA, Consultants, etc.) then updating data in-house, or subscribing to a smaller, more manageable database would be best because it’s more specific and constantly updated. A good middle ground is subscribing to a database and employing an internal data team to maintain it, so that you are constantly being given a new set of data that is updated and accurate.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'In-house vs. Outsourced Data Management: Which is Right for You?', 'content': "Did you know that 65% of people's job titles change every year?

It all depends on the needs of your team. Because Dakota is a database provider, we know the ins and outs of the space, and just how much time goes into ensuring everything is as updated as possible. But we know what you might be thinking: of course we’ll tell you that the best way forward is a third party, it’s what we do, after all. But that’s not the case; we know that not every company has the same size data, team, or budget. In this article, we’ll break down the pros and cons of keeping your data in-house versus hiring an outside, third party to keep up with it for you. By the end of this post, you’ll be able to decide which is best for your team, so that your data is as up to date as possible. Third party data maintenance options When it comes to third parties, you can go in a few different ways. You can get your data directly from an outside source (database subscription) and import it into your CRM or use an outsourced database administrator. A database subscription: You pay a yearly subscription fee in exchange for access to a database of accounts and contacts within the investment industry. These are specialized to fit the needs of the industry, and come in a variety of sizes, from hundreds of thousands of accounts and contacts, to a more scaled down list. Depending on the database your team chooses, you still might need to verify the data to ensure accuracy. A database administration system: These are software options that will help ensure that your data is as up to date as possible. These types of systems, offered by companies like Oracle, SentryOne, and Redgate, are often designed to complement your data team, rather than act as a single solution to data upkeep. Next, we’ll dive into the pros and cons of third party data management. The benefits of third party data management Greater efficiency: At the end of the day, outsourcing your data and data management is going to save you and your team time. Instead of hunting for information on who to call, it’s already at your fingertips and ready to use. This allows your sales team to get to work making calls and setting meetings, which leads to more deals closed. Access to large quantities of data: A third party database is able to pull a large amount of data in a short amount of time. This means your team will have access to a ton of information without spending hours of time researching it first. Databases are especially beneficial for large projects, or for when a company is trying to get a sense of a new industry or market. The drawbacks of third party data management Your data can get stale: If you’re getting your data from a third party source or relying strictly on the industry, your data can get stale, leading to outdated contact information. Instead you need to find and update contact information yourself, or update and build relationships with people, allowing you to keep it updated with minimal effort. The data isn’t always accurate: If you’re getting data from a third party, there is no guarantee that it will be one hundred percent correct. This could mean the need for human intervention and double checking data received, or working with the third party database administration system to oversee that it is correct. In-house data management The benefits of in-house data management Real-time updates: Having a dedicated person or team within your organization means having a dedicated resource to focus on cleaning up your data, so it will always be as accurate as possible. With a third party or software, there could be delays, especially if you are working with a large data set. In an industry where data can get stale very quickly, this can be a major downside that may sway you to keep things in-house. Dedication and trust: Having someone who understands the needs and goals of your business and can be focused on them adds a layer of trust to the process that may not exist with third party resources. The drawbacks of in-house data management It can be time consuming: It is a very time-intensive process to go through all of your data each day and ensure that it’s updated and accurate. Depending on the size of your data team, you might not be able to update as much information in bulk as a third party source or system would. So, which is right for you? This ultimately depends how specialized you and your company are. If you’re looking for a broad amount of accounts and contacts, then a third party data source would be better. If you’re more specialized in a specific channel, (RIA, Consultants, etc.) then updating data in-house, or subscribing to a smaller, more manageable database would be best because it’s more specific and constantly updated. A good middle ground is subscribing to a database and employing an internal data team to maintain it, so that you are constantly being given a new set of data that is updated and accurate.", 'bullet_points': [], 'subsections': []}], 'key_takeaways': [], 'faqs': []}

# article_072_consultant-led-private-equity-allocations-in-q3-20

{'title': 'Consultant Led Private Equity Allocations in Q3 2024', 'introduction': "In recent months, institutional investors have continued to emphasize private equity allocations, with consultants playing a key role in guiding these decisions. Across U.S. public pension and retirement systems, substantial commitments were directed toward a range of investment strategies, reflecting an ongoing appetite for diversified growth opportunities. Major consulting firms, including Aksia, Hamilton Lane Advisors, StepStone Group, and others, steered significant capital into funds focusing on buyouts, growth equity, and alternative lending strategies. For example, Aksia facilitated over $3.8 billion in allocations, with the Virginia Retirement System leading with a $750 million commitment to GCM Grosvenor VRS VI. Similarly, Hamilton Lane's advisory role resulted in $2.9 billion in commitments, with New York State Common Retirement Fund investing $400 million in the Kohlberg Empire State Co-Investment Fund. These examples underscore the strategic shifts among institutional investors toward private markets as they seek yield enhancement and diversification amid a challenging economic landscape. While the involvement of specific consultants in these investment decisions is not always explicitly confirmed in public documents, it is assumed that they provided guidance or assistance based on their role as private equity or general consultants for the respective institutions. In this article, we’re breaking down the largest public pension allocations to private equity from top consultants for the third quarter of 2024. By the end of this list, you’ll be able to understand which consultants are making the largest allocations. 1.

Across U.S. public pension and retirement systems, substantial commitments were directed toward a range of investment strategies, reflecting an ongoing appetite for diversified growth opportunities. Major consulting firms, including Aksia, Hamilton Lane Advisors, StepStone Group, and others, steered significant capital into funds focusing on buyouts, growth equity, and alternative lending strategies. For example, Aksia facilitated over $3.8 billion in allocations, with the Virginia Retirement System leading with a $750 million commitment to GCM Grosvenor VRS VI. Similarly, Hamilton Lane's advisory role resulted in $2.9 billion in commitments, with New York State Common Retirement Fund investing $400 million in the Kohlberg Empire State Co-Investment Fund. These examples underscore the strategic shifts among institutional investors toward private markets as they seek yield enhancement and diversification amid a challenging economic landscape. While the involvement of specific consultants in these investment decisions is not always explicitly confirmed in public documents, it is assumed that they provided guidance or assistance based on their role as private equity or general consultants for the respective institutions. In this article, we’re breaking down the largest public pension allocations to private equity from top consultants for the third quarter of 2024.

# article_118_the-top-form-adv-features-in-dakota-marketplace

{'title': 'The Top Form ADV Features in Dakota Marketplace', 'introduction': "In the complex world of investment sales, transparency and regulatory compliance are paramount - one of the key tools ensuring this transparency is Form ADV data. Form ADV is a comprehensive document that RIAs must file with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). If you are familiar with us at Dakota, you probably know we love RIAs - they are a goldmine for any investment sales professional. Form ADV provides critical information about an adviser's business practices, fees, conflicts of interest, and disciplinary history. Understanding and utilizing this data is crucial for fundraisers as it offers a detailed snapshot of an adviser's operations and regulatory status. Historically, government websites providing this information required users to have significant prior knowledge and expertise, offered antiquated user interfaces, and had minimal filtering capabilities. Dakota Marketplace overcomes these challenges with a user-friendly interface and powerful filtering options, which we will get into below. In this article we are going to review the top ADV features in Dakota Marketplace. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of these features and how they can assist you with your fundraising efforts. 1. AUM Filtering: In Dakota Marketplace, you will find dynamic AUM filtering capabilities. Users can view the total number of accounts and the total U.S. and non-U.S. dollar amounts across both discretionary and non-discretionary AUM. This feature allows for precise filtering based on AUM thresholds, setting minimum or maximum values, and similarly filtering by account numbers. For example, users can effortlessly search for all RIAs in Houston with over $10 billion in AUM spread across 150 or more accounts. This level of detailed filtering ensures that investment sales professionals can pinpoint exactly the advisers that meet their specific criteria, enhancing their research and decision-making processes. 2. AUM Changes: (Coming Soon) In addition to AUM filtering, users of Dakota Marketplace have the ability to track how an RIA’s AUM has changed over time. This feature provides a historical perspective on an adviser's asset growth or decline, allowing users to see trends and patterns in their financial management. Understanding these changes is crucial for investment sales professionals. Rapid growth in AUM may indicate an adviser's increasing popularity and success in attracting new clients, signaling strong performance and potential for future growth. A decline in AUM could raise red flags about possible issues within the firm, such as client dissatisfaction or poor investment performance. By monitoring these changes, professionals can make more informed decisions about which advisers to partner with or recommend, ensuring they align with their strategic goals and risk tolerance. 3. Client Base: Dakota Marketplace allows users to view the total number and type of clients, along with the associated AUM for each category. This feature is incredibly useful for fundraisers as it provides insights into the adviser's client demographics and the distribution of their assets. Users can filter this information based on various criteria. For example, you can search for all RIAs with over $100 billion in AUM that exclusively service a client base of Charitable Organizations or Pension and Profit Sharing Plans. Alternatively, you can identify all RIAs with over 1,000 high-net-worth (HNW) clients that contribute at least $20 billion to their overall AUM. This detailed filtering helps managers identify advisers who align with their target demographics and strategic goals, making informed decisions and tailoring services to specific client needs. 4. Advisory Services: Dakota Marketplace offers advanced filtering to analyze specific advisory services offered by RIAs. Users can filter based on criteria such as which RIAs use outside managers or run their own pooled investment vehicles. This feature is vital for investment sales professionals as it reveals key aspects of an adviser's business model and expertise. For example, RIAs running their own pooled vehicles may have greater control and sophistication, while those using outside managers might provide broader investment options. These insights help managers align with advisers whose services match their strategic needs and client preferences, ensuring effective partnerships and tailored investment solutions. 5. Asset Allocation Changes - Mid to End of Year Dakota Marketplace allows users to view asset allocation changes for RIAs based on mid-year and end-of-year values. This feature lets users track how assets are distributed across different investment categories over time. For instance, users can filter to find RIAs that had 50% of their assets in exchange-traded funds at the end of the year or simply observe how allocations have evolved. 6. Custodians: Dakota Marketplace provides insights into which custodians are used by RIAs and the amount of money held with each. For example, users can filter based on specific criteria, such as identifying RIAs with over $5 billion in AUM and more than $3 billion of their assets held at Schwab. This feature is invaluable for investment sales professionals, offering a clear view of an adviser's custodian relationships and asset distribution. Understanding these details helps managers evaluate the stability and preferences of RIAs, making it easier to align with partners whose custodian choices match their operational needs and client expectations. 7. Private Funds: Dakota Marketplace enables users to identify which RIAs are running their own fund of funds. This feature is particularly useful for private markets firms, as it indicates that servicing these RIAs will involve dealing with only a limited partner (LP) via the fund. This simplifies paperwork and fund documentation, streamlining administrative processes and reducing complexity. By knowing which RIAs manage their own fund of funds, investment sales professionals can efficiently target and engage with advisers, ensuring a smoother and more straightforward service experience while fostering effective partnerships in the private markets sector. 8. Feeder Funds: In Dakota Marketplace, users can view which RIAs are putting together feeder funds for specific private market managers through the Private Fund Sections. This feature allows investment sales professionals to filter and identify feeder funds associated with particular managers. For example, users can search for all RIA private funds that contain the term “Silver Lake” to identify RIAs investing with Silver Lake. This capability is crucial for understanding the investment networks and partnerships within the private markets, enabling professionals to target and engage with RIAs that align with their strategic interests and investment goals. 9. Owners: Lastly, Dakota Marketplace allows users to view the owners of an RIA and determine whether or not they are a control person. This feature is invaluable for investment sales professionals and potential acquirers, providing insights into the ownership structure and executive leadership of an advisory firm. Whether you are considering an acquisition or simply want to get to know the executive leadership better, this information is essential for making informed decisions and building strong, strategic relationships. Start researching! In conclusion, the features above of Form ADV data are crafted to give investment sales professional’s tools and detailed insights to better understand RIAs. By leveraging these features, you can streamline your research, make more informed decisions, and build stronger, more strategic relationships with RIAs. Dakota Marketplace equips you with the tools to efficiently target and engage with the right advisers, ultimately driving better outcomes for your fundraising efforts and contributing to your overall success as an investment sales professional.

Users can view the total number of accounts and the total U.S. and non-U.S. dollar amounts across both discretionary and non-discretionary AUM. This feature allows for precise filtering based on AUM thresholds, setting minimum or maximum values, and similarly filtering by account numbers. For example, users can effortlessly search for all RIAs in Houston with over $10 billion in AUM spread across 150 or more accounts. This level of detailed filtering ensures that investment sales professionals can pinpoint exactly the advisers that meet their specific criteria, enhancing their research and decision-making processes. 2. AUM Changes: (Coming Soon) In addition to AUM filtering, users of Dakota Marketplace have the ability to track how an RIA’s AUM has changed over time. This feature provides a historical perspective on an adviser's asset growth or decline, allowing users to see trends and patterns in their financial management. Understanding these changes is crucial for investment sales professionals. Rapid growth in AUM may indicate an adviser's increasing popularity and success in attracting new clients, signaling strong performance and potential for future growth. A decline in AUM could raise red flags about possible issues within the firm, such as client dissatisfaction or poor investment performance. By monitoring these changes, professionals can make more informed decisions about which advisers to partner with or recommend, ensuring they align with their strategic goals and risk tolerance. 3. Client Base: Dakota Marketplace allows users to view the total number and type of clients, along with the associated AUM for each category. This feature is incredibly useful for fundraisers as it provides insights into the adviser's client demographics and the distribution of their assets. Users can filter this information based on various criteria. For example, you can search for all RIAs with over $100 billion in AUM that exclusively service a client base of Charitable Organizations or Pension and Profit Sharing Plans. Alternatively, you can identify all RIAs with over 1,000 high-net-worth (HNW) clients that contribute at least $20 billion to their overall AUM. This detailed filtering helps managers identify advisers who align with their target demographics and strategic goals, making informed decisions and tailoring services to specific client needs. 4. Advisory Services: Dakota Marketplace offers advanced filtering to analyze specific advisory services offered by RIAs. Users can filter based on criteria such as which RIAs use outside managers or run their own pooled investment vehicles. This feature is vital for investment sales professionals as it reveals key aspects of an adviser's business model and expertise. For example, RIAs running their own pooled vehicles may have greater control and sophistication, while those using outside managers might provide broader investment options. These insights help managers align with advisers whose services match their strategic needs and client preferences, ensuring effective partnerships and tailored investment solutions. 5. Asset Allocation Changes - Mid to End of Year Dakota Marketplace allows users to view asset allocation changes for RIAs based on mid-year and end-of-year values. This feature lets users track how assets are distributed across different investment categories over time. For instance, users can filter to find RIAs that had 50% of their assets in exchange-traded funds at the end of the year or simply observe how allocations have evolved. 6. Custodians: Dakota Marketplace provides insights into which custodians are used by RIAs and the amount of money held with each. For example, users can filter based on specific criteria, such as identifying RIAs with over $5 billion in AUM and more than $3 billion of their assets held at Schwab. This feature is invaluable for investment sales professionals, offering a clear view of an adviser's custodian relationships and asset distribution. Understanding these details helps managers evaluate the stability and preferences of RIAs, making it easier to align with partners whose custodian choices match their operational needs and client expectations. 7. Private Funds: Dakota Marketplace enables users to identify which RIAs are running their own fund of funds. This feature is particularly useful for private markets firms, as it indicates that servicing these RIAs will involve dealing with only a limited partner (LP) via the fund. This simplifies paperwork and fund documentation, streamlining administrative processes and reducing complexity. By knowing which RIAs manage their own fund of funds, investment sales professionals can efficiently target and engage with advisers, ensuring a smoother and more straightforward service experience while fostering effective partnerships in the private markets sector. 8. Feeder Funds: In Dakota Marketplace, users can view which RIAs are putting together feeder funds for specific private market managers through the Private Fund Sections. This feature allows investment sales professionals to filter and identify feeder funds associated with particular managers. For example, users can search for all RIA private funds that contain the term “Silver Lake” to identify RIAs investing with Silver Lake. This capability is crucial for understanding the investment networks and partnerships within the private markets, enabling professionals to target and engage with RIAs that align with their strategic interests and investment goals. 9. Owners: Lastly, Dakota Marketplace allows users to view the owners of an RIA and determine whether or not they are a control person. This feature is invaluable for investment sales professionals and potential acquirers, providing insights into the ownership structure and executive leadership of an advisory firm. Whether you are considering an acquisition or simply want to get to know the executive leadership better, this information is essential for making informed decisions and building strong, strategic relationships. Start researching! In conclusion, the features above of Form ADV data are crafted to give investment sales professional’s tools and detailed insights to better understand RIAs. By leveraging these features, you can streamline your research, make more informed decisions, and build stronger, more strategic relationships with RIAs. Dakota Marketplace equips you with the tools to efficiently target and engage with the right advisers, ultimately driving better outcomes for your fundraising efforts and contributing to your overall success as an investment sales professional.

# article_051_private-markets-on-the-rise-whats-next-for-private

{'title': "Private Markets on the Rise: What's Next for Private Equity Investors?", 'introduction': "Since 2010, private equity has seen remarkable growth, fueled by increased investor demand, favorable market conditions, and a surge in available capital. What was once considered a niche investment arena has now become a mainstream powerhouse, reshaping private markets and driving financial decisions on a global scale. Looking back over the past decade, it’s clear that private equity isn’t just expanding – it’s redefining how investors approach long-term value creation and opportunity. For both seasoned investment sales professionals and those just beginning to explore private markets, it's an exciting time to take a closer look at the key trends and strategies that have driven this growth. From diversification into new sectors like technology and healthcare to innovative approaches in deal structuring, private equity is no longer just about capital – it's about agility and adaptability in an ever-changing financial landscape. In this article, we’ll explore four key drivers behind the rapid expansion of private markets. By the end, you'll gain a clearer understanding of the forces shaping this dynamic sector and what the future holds for private equity. Institutional Shift Post-2008 Crisis In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, institutional investors like pension funds, endowments, and sovereign wealth funds increasingly turned to private equity as a way to achieve higher returns amid low-interest-rate environments. This was largely due to the underperformance of traditional asset classes, which were delivering historically low yields, and equities, which were still reeling from the volatility of the crisis. New call-to-action Private equity, with its ability to offer outsized returns, became an attractive alternative, particularly for investors looking to meet long-term liabilities. As a result, this influx of capital allowed private equity firms to expand both in terms of AUM and geographic reach. Changes in Transaction Activity In recent years, there’s been a noticeable shift in transaction activity within private equity. As global deal volumes have declined, largely due to rising interest rates and inflationary pressures, firms have had to adjust their strategies. The traditional buyout model has faced increasing challenges as borrowing costs have risen. In response, private equity firms are diversifying their focus into areas such as growth equity, venture capital, special situations, secondaries, and fund of funds. This broader approach allows firms to pursue a wider range of opportunities, adapting to various market conditions. Growth equity and venture capital, for instance, are providing new avenues for investments in expanding companies and early-stage innovation, particularly in sectors like technology. Meanwhile, special situations and secondaries are creating opportunities for value creation, even in distressed or more complex environments. Fund of funds have also gained popularity as they offer a diversified portfolio of private equity investments, appealing to a wider range of investors. New call-to-action Additionally, firms are placing greater emphasis on operational improvements, digital transformation, and strategic add-on acquisitions to drive value creation within their portfolio companies. This shift away from financial engineering towards enhancing business operations has allowed private equity to continue thriving, even in a challenging macroeconomic environment. Exponential Growth in AUM According to Bain & Company’s 2023 Global Private Equity Report, the industry's AUM has more than tripled compared to 2010, exceeding $6 trillion globally. This explosive growth reflects both the increased investor appetite for alternative investments and the ability of private equity firms to deliver strong, risk-adjusted returns. Additionally, the industry's diversified strategies have contributed to this growth. Private equity has expanded beyond traditional leveraged buyouts into areas like growth equity, venture capital, and distressed debt, allowing firms to invest across various stages of company development. Sectors such as technology, healthcare, and infrastructure have attracted significant interest, thanks to their growth potential and resilience during economic downturns. Technology in particular has been a focus, with the increasing demand for digital transformation across industries. Investments in cloud computing, cybersecurity, fintech, and artificial intelligence have surged, as firms recognize the importance of these technologies in shaping the future of business. Challenges and Future Outlook Despite its impressive growth, private equity still faces significant challenges in the years ahead. The rising cost of debt financing is likely to continue impacting deal-making, particularly for firms that have historically relied on leverage to amplify returns. Additionally, increased competition from other asset classes, including private debt and real assets, is likely to put pressure on private equity returns. However, the industry's long-term growth prospects remain strong. With institutional investors continuing to seek out alternative investments, and with private equity firms finding innovative ways to generate value, the industry is well-positioned for future growth. The continued expansion into emerging markets, the rise of secondary markets, and the growing focus on operational value creation are all trends that will shape the private equity landscape for years to come.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': "Private Markets on the Rise: What's Next for Private Equity Investors?", 'content': "Since 2010, private equity has seen remarkable growth, fueled by increased investor demand, favorable market conditions, and a surge in available capital.

# article_313_the-5-best-crms-for-ria-firms-in-2023

{'title': 'The 5 Best CRMs for RIA Firms in 2023', 'introduction': "Have you ever found yourself scrambling, trying to remember who you met with last week, two weeks ago, even a month ago? You know you have to follow up, but you’re just not sure with whom. It’s a terrible feeling, and one we’ve all felt before, especially in the investment sales business. However, as we’ve said time and again, following up after a meeting is critical. It can mean the difference between building a relationship and getting an allocation and being forgotten, and we all know which outcome we want. After all, you’re not putting in all that work to set the meeting in the first place for nothing, right? Right. That means, you need to be diligent about following up, and we whole-heartedly believe that you can’t do that without a CRM. At Dakota, we eat, sleep, and breathe our CRM, using it for everything from following up after a meeting to reporting and keeping up to date on meeting notes.

# article_319_5-major-benefits-of-logging-meetings-in-your-crm

{'title': '5 Major Benefits of Logging Meetings in Your CRM', 'introduction': "Have you struggled with getting your sales team embrace entering meeting details in your CRM? Or, have they entered the meetings, but not the meeting notes? If you answered yes to either of these questions, you're definitely not alone. As you start pushing for CRM adoption at your firm, there will likely be some resistance. It's normal, and it will take some time before everyone is 100% on board. But, it's important to remind yourself and your team that the benefits always out weight the initial effort. Entering meetings scheduled and meeting notes into your CRM is one of the simplest, but most important things your sales team can do. However, under current situations, the workflow to get those meetings entered is clunky, which makes things difficult. Entering meetings into Salesforce can be challenging because it so often means double entry: scheduling the meeting on your calendar, then entering it into Salesforce, then coming back later and entering your notes. It's tedious. However, if you’re able to get the scheduled meetings into your CRM 100% of the time, there’s a ton of doors that will open for you. In this article, we're outlining the five key benefits of entering meeting notes, and all of the subsequent things you'll be able to do with that information. By the end of the article, you'll have a clear path forward, and a better understanding of the benefits of using your CRM to the fullest extent. 1. Create lists, by salesperson, of the meetings they’ve had over a set amount of time Whether that list contains activity from the last 2 weeks, 30 days, 90 days etc., logging meetings in your CRM will allow you to know exactly how many meetings each salesperson has had, and with whom. This simple task allows your team to be much more organized so that they can focus on effective and efficient follow-up in a timely manner. 2. Create team score cards Once you have meetings entered and lists created, your organization can now create and run reports. When a meeting is scheduled, you'll need to enter a meeting type: client services, first time, follow up, etc. Once you have that down, you'll be able to run reports by meeting types to create score cards tracking the number of meetings, the meeting type, etc. Because of this, everyone on the team has insight into these key, important metrics, which is critical as you continue to build and execute against your pipeline. 3. Create a seamless onboarding plan By entering the meetings that have been scheduled, you're essentially creating a map for new salespeople as they join the team. Now that you're tracking and keeping a log of all the meetings that have been done, if there’s turnover, a new salesperson can easily takes over and see exactly where the prior salesperson was meeting, with whom, etc. This allows any new team members to know exactly where their predecessor has been, and what they’ve done. It’s costly for the organization not to capture these things.. they’re losing money when they don’t track. 4. Keep everyone informed with auto-generated report emails With meetings entered in your CRM, automated emails can be created out of your CRM that will send an email at the end of the day showing a list of all meetings that have been scheduled by the team. With this, the whole team is able to see what the day looked like in terms of all the things they’ve done. What type of meetings were help, with whom, when it was scheduled for. This one simple email ensures that everyone is on the same page about what’s being done, even if they're on the road. 5. Make data-driven decisions Now that you're able to analyze the activity performance of your sales team, you'll be able to make much more informed decisions about next steps, growth, and goals. How to get started There is always a root cause if your CRM isn’t getting adopted. More often than not, this is because the information within the CRM is not useful to the sales team; if it was, everyone would be logging in. If the data was up to date, and they could view past activity to inform their follow-up outreach, it would be a no-brainer. However, we know that people to change natural behaviors is really hard — instead of fighting an uphill battle, you have to make it useful. What's more, they're able to log meeting notes directly in the app, which will auto-upload into Salesforce.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': '5 Major Benefits of Logging Meetings in Your CRM', 'content': "Have you struggled with getting your sales team embrace entering meeting details in your CRM? Or, have they entered the meetings, but not the meeting notes? If you answered yes to either of these questions, you're definitely not alone. As you start pushing for CRM adoption at your firm, there will likely be some resistance. It's normal, and it will take some time before everyone is 100% on board. But, it's important to remind yourself and your team that the benefits always out weight the initial effort. Entering meetings scheduled and meeting notes into your CRM is one of the simplest, but most important things your sales team can do. However, under current situations, the workflow to get those meetings entered is clunky, which makes things difficult. Entering meetings into Salesforce can be challenging because it so often means double entry: scheduling the meeting on your calendar, then entering it into Salesforce, then coming back later and entering your notes. It's tedious. However, if you’re able to get the scheduled meetings into your CRM 100% of the time, there’s a ton of doors that will open for you. In this article, we're outlining the five key benefits of entering meeting notes, and all of the subsequent things you'll be able to do with that information. By the end of the article, you'll have a clear path forward, and a better understanding of the benefits of using your CRM to the fullest extent. 1.

# article_389_the-10-public-pension-funds-to-watch-in-2021

{'title': 'The 10 Public Pension Funds to Watch in 2021', 'introduction': "It might seem like public pensions are a thing of the past given the general declining use of pensions as a retirement vehicle. However, public pension plans remain one of the most important and largest allocators to institutional alternative investments. Do you know the best ones to call on? Knowing not just who to call on at the public pensions, but their investment preferences and key consulting relationships is necessary for success for any alternative investment marketing professional. While public pensions have a reputation of conservative investing and working with only the largest and most established managers, they are increasingly growing in sophistication and turning to alternatives as a source of uncorrelated return during a period of protracted low interest rates. Many public plans have also been increasingly willing to work with emerging managers either directly or through programs developed by some of the leading investment consulting firms. At Dakota, we’ve been raising capital since 2006, and have raised over $30 billion dollars over the last fourteen years. In that time we’ve also established Dakota Marketplace, a database of accounts and contacts built by fundraisers for fundraisers. Marketplace is a compilation of fourteen years of research, and finding the right people to call on for our business. We think it can help you, too, and it helped inform this list. In this article, we’re sharing Dakota’s list of top North American public pensions to call on, and while the list is by no means exhaustive (or in every instance the largest allocator), it is a great starting point for anyone marketing an alternative strategy.

# article_362_two-email-types-every-investment-firm-should-know

{'title': 'Two Email Types Every Investment Firm Should Know About — And When to Use Them', 'introduction': 'If you’re a salesperson, you already know how important email is to getting a meeting. After all, nothing can happen without that initial meeting, so it’s critical that we are continually testing what types of emails get results and which don’t. We all understand that communication is key to helping any business stay above water. In fact, digital communication through email has become even more prevalent over the past year and a half, and we can assure you that it’s not going away anytime soon. Here at Dakota, we have a dedicated sales team that spends a great deal of time setting up meetings and conference calls, reaching out to clients and prospects, and of course, consistently following up. From this, we’ve learned how important it is to put a lot of thought into the type of email you’re sending to clients and prospects. We’ve broken it down to two main email types: direct emails and mass emails. In this article we’ll discuss the two types of emails every investment firm should know about, as well as how to measure success with your emails. By the end of this article, you’ll have a clear vision on when to use which type of email, and how to do so effectively. 1. Direct emails You’ll want to take the direct email approach when your message is tailored to a specific individual. This includes asking for anything one-on-one such as calls, meetings, etc. When emailing due diligence analysts or qualified prospects, make it personal. Reflect back on your prior conversations and include some of these topics within your email. People like to feel valued and not as though they’re just another sale to you. Another thing you’ll want to do in your email is establish yourself as credible. If a new search appears, you’ll want to be a part of this! If you come across as credible it’s very likely you’ll be included in it. Now to get people to open your direct email, you’ll need to have a short, clear subject line. One great tool we recommend using is SubjectLine.com. This site will rate your subject line and show you the criteria they rated it on. They’ll also offer advice on how to improve it in order to meet industry standards. 2. Mass emails As one could predict, you’ll want to send a mass email when sending to a large audience. Examples of this include quarterly invitations, quarterly newsletters, updates on performance, etc. I’m sure your firm has tools to capture updated information, however, you’re going to want to be able to provide prospects and clients with these updates. This is where it’s helpful to send a mass email with the newly updated information and redirect people to the website that contains this information as well. Not only do your prospects and clients benefit from mass emails, but so do you. You can use this approach as a form of prospecting to keep in touch with those who are qualified candidates. It gives this group of people an idea of your investment strategy, and how much career risk will come out of this. It gives them security that post-investment they’ll have this information. Lastly, it gives them an early look into what the client experience will look like with your investment firm. Make sure you’re sending mass emails quarterly at the minimum to provide these updates to prospects and due diligence analysts. If you do this, you’re in their inbox on a quarterly basis at the least. Now we’ll discuss the metrics you need to look at in order to determine if your email was successful or not, and follow up with tips for acknowledgement within your emails. How to measure the success of your emails There are three metrics you’ll need to look at to draw a conclusion on how successful your email is: Number of deliveries Open rate Click-through rate The percentage for the number of deliveries will inform you on whether you have the correct email for people. You’ll want to make sure you’re sending the email to a clean, accurate list of contacts. The open rate will tell you the percentage of people who opened your email. This percentage gives you feedback on whether you chose a good subject line and preview text. Lastly, the click-through rate will inform you on engagement from your email. This percentage tells you how successful the content of your email was; whether or not your call to action created a sense of urgency to the recipient to click the link within the body. How to optimize your emails To get the most out of your emails, you’ll need your prospects and clients to read them. It’s important to make sure you form the email in an effective way. Be short and direct, make it easy to respond, and give them a reason to respond. Another great way for your emails to get acknowledged is having it come from a person. This may seem obvious, but it’s commonly overlooked. Having your email come from a real person and not just a generic address makes it more personal. Like I stated earlier, it’s all about showing this person that they mean something to you and that they’re not just another sale. Get started and take your emails to the next level If you feel like you’re doing these things, maybe more, and aren’t getting acknowledgement on your emails - you’re not alone. It can be difficult to get analysts to open your emails, we know. We’ve provided some tips that have worked for us on how to fix your emails if you’re still struggling to get your investment sales emails read.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'Two Email Types Every Investment Firm Should Know About — And When to Use Them', 'content': 'If you’re a salesperson, you already know how important email is to getting a meeting.

Examples of this include quarterly invitations, quarterly newsletters, updates on performance, etc. I’m sure your firm has tools to capture updated information, however, you’re going to want to be able to provide prospects and clients with these updates. This is where it’s helpful to send a mass email with the newly updated information and redirect people to the website that contains this information as well. Not only do your prospects and clients benefit from mass emails, but so do you. You can use this approach as a form of prospecting to keep in touch with those who are qualified candidates. It gives this group of people an idea of your investment strategy, and how much career risk will come out of this. It gives them security that post-investment they’ll have this information. Lastly, it gives them an early look into what the client experience will look like with your investment firm. Make sure you’re sending mass emails quarterly at the minimum to provide these updates to prospects and due diligence analysts. If you do this, you’re in their inbox on a quarterly basis at the least. Now we’ll discuss the metrics you need to look at in order to determine if your email was successful or not, and follow up with tips for acknowledgement within your emails. How to measure the success of your emails There are three metrics you’ll need to look at to draw a conclusion on how successful your email is: Number of deliveries Open rate Click-through rate The percentage for the number of deliveries will inform you on whether you have the correct email for people. You’ll want to make sure you’re sending the email to a clean, accurate list of contacts. The open rate will tell you the percentage of people who opened your email. This percentage gives you feedback on whether you chose a good subject line and preview text. Lastly, the click-through rate will inform you on engagement from your email. This percentage tells you how successful the content of your email was; whether or not your call to action created a sense of urgency to the recipient to click the link within the body. How to optimize your emails To get the most out of your emails, you’ll need your prospects and clients to read them. It’s important to make sure you form the email in an effective way. Be short and direct, make it easy to respond, and give them a reason to respond. Another great way for your emails to get acknowledged is having it come from a person. This may seem obvious, but it’s commonly overlooked. Having your email come from a real person and not just a generic address makes it more personal. Like I stated earlier, it’s all about showing this person that they mean something to you and that they’re not just another sale. Get started and take your emails to the next level If you feel like you’re doing these things, maybe more, and aren’t getting acknowledgement on your emails - you’re not alone. It can be difficult to get analysts to open your emails, we know. We’ve provided some tips that have worked for us on how to fix your emails if you’re still struggling to get your investment sales emails read.', 'bullet_points': [], 'subsections': []}], 'key_takeaways': [], 'faqs': []}

# article_258_benefits-of-hosting-a-corporate-offsite-meeting

{'title': 'Benefits of Hosting a Corporate Offsite Meeting', 'introduction': 'After almost 3 years since COVID changed our world, people are still missing in-person meetings — in fact, 84% of people reported that they prefer to meet in person. Face to face meetings are here to stay as they are a critical component of building strong culture, developing rapport, and connecting with people on a deeper level. Culture is so crucial to a company. Without a healthy culture there is no trust amongst your peers. Hosting an offsite meeting with the opportunity for your employees to mingle amongst each other will help develop the strong culture every firm desires. At Dakota, a dakota-ism of ours is “walk the eight feet”. This entails walking to the office next door for a question or sharing an idea. Walking the eight feet goes hand in hand with being in person face to face, which inspired us to create Dakota Meets. Dakota Meets is a space for our team to connect and be together. We host each team’s monthly offsite, our quarterly company wide offsite, and other networking events here. We want this to be somewhere you and other industry peers can benefit from! The Dakota Meets room has floor to ceiling windows offering a beautiful view of Center City Philadelphia. It also includes several other amenities: 75” free-standing TV screen to share your laptop screen, display remote attendees, show videos and photos, and more 9 foot white board for writing down ideas and collaborating Zoom Capabilities for remote attendees or speakers Space Customization to move the tables and chairs to a more open floor plan or seating layout to your liking Flexibility when it comes to the layout of your event with several seating options to meet your needs Dedicated video team on-site to ensure everything is captured, setup, etc. Kitchen with select appliances to sit and eat food, or set up food for a buffet style Partnering with our exclusive caterers, Blackfish In this article, we will discuss the benefits of meeting in person, and why people prefer it. After reading this you will have a better understanding of the benefits in hosting an offsite meeting, and how partnering with Dakota Meets can help you achieve a successful and impactful in-person meeting. 1. Build long-term relationships One of the most important benefits for hosting an offsite meeting is you are more likely to form a long-term relationship with attendees. Seeing people face to face helps us connect more with them and develop a deeper sense of trust. Because they aren’t hiding behind a computer screen, their words seem to mean more - and there’s always the physical action of “shaking on it”, which we can’t do over a screen. In addition, traveling somewhere to meet in person shows a client, boss, or employee that you value their time and business. They will be able to understand you value them and be more inclined to continue business. In fact, it was reported that 40% of prospects converted to new customers through face-to-face meetings. 2. Clear communication Being in person allows for clear and open communication amongst the team. It forces people to speak their truth. More ideas are shared amongst the group of individuals and they can easily build off of one another. This also creates a better environment for more complex, strategic thinking. You are also able to read body language and interpret nonverbal cues, which cannot be done through a virtual meeting. A recent statistic shows that only 7% of someone’s language is communicated through actual words, 38% through the way the words are spoken, and 55% through facial expressions. Being behind a computer screen restricts this part of communication, especially if cameras are not turned on during a meeting. 3. Higher attention level A face to face meeting requires people to pay more attention to the speakers, so that there is no disconnect in an in-person meeting, and no room for distractions. This will correlate to a higher retention rate for the meeting at hand. When it comes to a meeting on Zoom it is more likely that people are multitasking during their meeting. Whether they’re answering emails or folding their laundry, their full attention is not to the work at hand. 4. Get away from the office Hosting an offsite meeting with your company is a great way to get everyone out of the house and office! For people that work from home, it can be nice to see familiar faces away from a computer screen and get to socialize with their coworkers. It can also be nice for employees to get away from the office and form more of a relationship amongst their coworkers outside of work. The Dakota Meets space is open and offers catering for you and your employees to come in, eat, networking, and form deeper connections. What are you waiting for? To start planning for your next corporate offsite meeting, email dakota_meets@dakota.co. One of our team members will be in contact with you to organize a visit and get you started on collaborating face to face with your team! In addition to working with Dakota Meets, you will have access to our exclusive catering partner if you wish to have food at your event! The catering team knows the space very well, and there’s no need for your team to clean up before or after the event.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'Benefits of Hosting a Corporate Offsite Meeting', 'content': 'After almost 3 years since COVID changed our world, people are still missing in-person meetings — in fact, 84% of people reported that they prefer to meet in person.

By the end of this, you\'ll know how to avoid them by implementing a few practices into your day to day. The 7 deadly sins of investment sales 1. Expectation misalignment The disconnect between CEOs, portfolio managers, and sales leaders can create a volatile foundation for any sales team. Ensuring alignment across all levels is crucial for fostering a cohesive and high-performing team. 2. Chasing the wrong prospects The allure of big names can be misleading. Identifying and connecting with the right prospects who genuinely align with your offerings is key to efficient and effective sales. 3.

Losing grip on meetings Meetings without direction can lead to missed opportunities and negative impressions. Steering conversations with confidence is vital for achieving desired outcomes. 6. Settling for "great meetings" Being content with meetings that feel successful but lack clear next steps can halt progress. Focus on actionable outcomes to drive the sales process forward. 7. Forgetting to capture and leverage insights Every interaction with a prospect is an opportunity for insight. Failing to capture these moments in your CRM can result in lost potential. Treat your CRM as a treasure trove of valuable data. The 7 transformative shifts 1. Aligning visions for empowerment Harmonizing the visions of key stakeholders can transform stress into synergy, paving the way for a thriving sales environment. 2. Focusing on authentic connections Shift from chasing prestigious names to forming genuine connections with prospects aligned with your strategy for more meaningful and impactful sales. 3. Cultivating your market garden View your TAM as a garden that requires constant attention, where success blooms from understanding and nurturing your market. 4. Harnessing the power of story Unlock the stories within your products to transform pitches into captivating journeys that resonate deeply with your audience. 5. Mastering the art of meeting navigation Prepare and control your meetings to ensure they consistently drive toward your goals, making every interaction impactful. 6. Beyond "great meetings" Look for transformation and actionable steps in every meeting to ensure real progress in your sales process. 7.

# article_395_5-benefits-of-adding-an-additional-marketplace-use

{'title': '5 Benefits of Adding an Additional Marketplace User', 'introduction': 'If you’re a Marketplace member, chances are you already know the benefits that come from a Marketplace subscription. If you’re not a Marketplace member, well, don’t take our word for it — in a recent survey, 75% of our members reported that they scheduled a significant number of meetings over the last three to six months because of Marketplace. There’s a definite benefit to streamlining your time and focusing solely on setting meetings rather than researching who to call on, which is exactly what Marketplace allows you to do. By getting the whole team involved, you’ll see more potential leads and meetings than ever before. In this post, we’ll highlight some of the major benefits our users have encountered after adding additional users to their Marketplace instance. Of course, as the provider of Marketplace, we know what you’re thinking: do they just want us to spend more money? And that’s a fair question! But we’re here first and foremost to help you make the decision whether or not adding another user is right for you. Benefits of adding an additional Dakota Marketplace user Adding more users means more leads. When you have more people working within a database platform, you’re going to see more results. Our recent survey showed that 75% of users have scheduled three meetings in the last six months due to Marketplace. As you add more users to the platform, more people are using the data and scheduling meetings, the more meetings you are going to be able to set up. Your sales team can become more strategic within multiple channels. You can establish different teams based on specific channels (RIAs, institutional, consultants, etc.) This will allow your team to become laser-focused on each channel, so that you can start setting up more meetings within each one. Setting up a planned, strategic way of setting up meetings allows the team to be more in sync, organized, and will lead to more meetings and sales. Increased collaboration and efficiency both within and outside of the sales team. Some of our members have added licenses for their Business Development team in addition to their sales team, and have seen great success in aligning the two teams. Since it is often the role of business development to research leads to pass to sales, having them in the system streamlines that process and allows for them to work in tandem through the existing, qualified leads within Marketplace. More users means more access to the replays of Dakota Live! Calls. This is one of the most popular features within Marketplace, as the calls provide valuable insight into the accounts and contacts within Marketplace, and the Dakota Live! Calls help bring that data to life. Because no two users can be logged in at the same time, having the additional user means that one person can be doing the research within Marketplace, and one can be logged in listening to the replays and gaining insights that way. Every user can build out their own preferences, specific to their needs through favorites, as well as create lists that are customized to them. This makes the data more accessible and easy to manage for each individual user, whereas sharing just one account would be relying on only one person’s preferences as you navigate through the system. By creating your own, you’ll increase efficiency as you set up calls and meetings. Ultimately, the biggest value is that the more users you have looking at the data, the more people you have doing outreach to schedule meetings. Who else should be added to the platform? While Marketplace is primarily used by investment sales teams, it can be used by anyone in the firm, including people who handle: Calls: If someone is setting up calls, knowing who to call and how to reach them is the first step, all of which can be found easily within Marketplace. Data and Reports building: Anyone running reports on accounts and contacts for the team can benefit from the reports feature within Marketplace, which features an easy to use data and reporting interface. Setting meetings with prospects: This could be anyone from the Sales or Business Development teams. If you’re setting and attending meetings with prospects, it all starts with knowing who to meet with. How much does an additional user license cost? Adding an additional user is $1,000 per user per year. Is adding an additional user right for me? While it depends on the size and needs of each individual firm, adding users to your Marketplace subscription can result in a more streamlined process for setting up meetings with the right people. If you have a broad team with each person focusing on a different channel, or a variety of teams setting calls and meetings, adding additional users will not only increase collaboration and efficiency, but it will save your team time and money in the end. Time formerly spent researching and filling in data gaps can now be spent doing outreach to the people who buy what you sell with a free trial of Dakota Marketplace.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': '5 Benefits of Adding an Additional Marketplace User', 'content': 'If you’re a Marketplace member, chances are you already know the benefits that come from a Marketplace subscription.

You can establish different teams based on specific channels (RIAs, institutional, consultants, etc.) This will allow your team to become laser-focused on each channel, so that you can start setting up more meetings within each one. Setting up a planned, strategic way of setting up meetings allows the team to be more in sync, organized, and will lead to more meetings and sales. Increased collaboration and efficiency both within and outside of the sales team. Some of our members have added licenses for their Business Development team in addition to their sales team, and have seen great success in aligning the two teams. Since it is often the role of business development to research leads to pass to sales, having them in the system streamlines that process and allows for them to work in tandem through the existing, qualified leads within Marketplace. More users means more access to the replays of Dakota Live! Calls. This is one of the most popular features within Marketplace, as the calls provide valuable insight into the accounts and contacts within Marketplace, and the Dakota Live! Calls help bring that data to life. Because no two users can be logged in at the same time, having the additional user means that one person can be doing the research within Marketplace, and one can be logged in listening to the replays and gaining insights that way. Every user can build out their own preferences, specific to their needs through favorites, as well as create lists that are customized to them. This makes the data more accessible and easy to manage for each individual user, whereas sharing just one account would be relying on only one person’s preferences as you navigate through the system. By creating your own, you’ll increase efficiency as you set up calls and meetings. Ultimately, the biggest value is that the more users you have looking at the data, the more people you have doing outreach to schedule meetings. Who else should be added to the platform? While Marketplace is primarily used by investment sales teams, it can be used by anyone in the firm, including people who handle: Calls: If someone is setting up calls, knowing who to call and how to reach them is the first step, all of which can be found easily within Marketplace. Data and Reports building: Anyone running reports on accounts and contacts for the team can benefit from the reports feature within Marketplace, which features an easy to use data and reporting interface. Setting meetings with prospects: This could be anyone from the Sales or Business Development teams. If you’re setting and attending meetings with prospects, it all starts with knowing who to meet with. How much does an additional user license cost? Adding an additional user is $1,000 per user per year. Is adding an additional user right for me? While it depends on the size and needs of each individual firm, adding users to your Marketplace subscription can result in a more streamlined process for setting up meetings with the right people. If you have a broad team with each person focusing on a different channel, or a variety of teams setting calls and meetings, adding additional users will not only increase collaboration and efficiency, but it will save your team time and money in the end. Time formerly spent researching and filling in data gaps can now be spent doing outreach to the people who buy what you sell with a free trial of Dakota Marketplace.', 'bullet_points': [], 'subsections': []}], 'key_takeaways': [], 'faqs': []}

# article_234_the-top-ria-databases-and-how-to-get-the-most-out

{'title': 'The Top RIA Databases and How to Get the Most Out of Them', 'introduction': 'At Dakota we have been raising capital within the RIA channel since 1997 and have raised over $9 billion. Let’s be clear, the RIA channel is a tough channel to sell into because of its vastness. If killing elephants would be akin to winning a model allocation at a Bank or Broker-Dealer, killing squirrels would be akin to winning in the RIA channel. In this article, we dive into the challenges of penetrating the RIA channel as well as the sales process any fundraiser needs to use in order to face these challenges. By the end of this you’ll have a better understanding of the issues many face when approaching the RIA channel and the databases that can help you implement our recommended sales process. The RIA channel is an astounding channel to sell into since the level of openness to new ideas and the threshold of sophistication knows no bounds. RIA firms are always looking for new and interesting investment ideas, making them the holy grail for any money manager. If it’s the holy grail, what makes the RIA channel such a challenge relative to other channels like Banks, Consultants, Broker-Dealers or Wirehouses? There is no top-down approval. Each RIA needs to do full due diligence on each individual strategy they invest in. Going back to the squirrel concept, RIAs are spread out all over the country requiring a lot of travel. Traditionally, most RIA databases don’t fully distinguish between RIAs that are money managers and those that are wealth managers. This makes the research process for who to call on very time consuming. You’ll need to pare down 20,000+ RIAs to the ones that matter. In the past 5 years many private fund managers have wanted to access the RIA channel, but only have an LP to offer, not a mutual fund, separate account or ETF as product wrappers. This makes the need to understand which RIAs invest in LPs absolutely paramount. So what is the solution? You need to find the answers to these three things, and then apply the sales process we swear by below: What RIAs are wealth managers?, What RIAs invest in my asset class?, and What RIAs invest heavily in LPs if you only have an LP? The Sales Process The approach we recommend to both our customers and ourselves at Dakota is not complicated, although it requires an intense, consistent application of a sales process. You’ll need two things to efficiently attack the RIA channel: 1) a curated database of RIAs who invest in outside managers; and 2) City Scheduling. Having the proper database will save you an insane amount of research time, and it will also result in an easier attempt at city scheduling. With that, let’s get into city scheduling. City Scheduling 50% of the RIAs in the US are in the top 12 Metro Areas. Step one is to pick 5 of those Metro Areas for any given date and send email meeting requests for 9:00am, 11:00am, 1:00pm, 3:00pm and 4:30pm. When one Metro drops, add another. Step two is to remove the top 12 Metro Areas and run a report of the remaining largest RIAs and pick those Metros to schedule face to face meetings via email meeting requests. That is it! A curated database and a consistent sales process that results in many face to face meetings. Apply this process consistently, and with a good product, results should come over time. Unfortunately, it can take time. Be patient and consistent. Below we’ve suggested four databases, so you can decide which is the best fit for you. Curated Databases These are the databases the investment community has to choose from when cold prospecting the RIA channel with the sales process above. Fintrx: contains $115 trillion total investment advisor assets tracked and 6.3 million total investment advisor data points covered for your outreach. Discovery Data: helps companies grow their business in the financial services and insurance industries. They provide detailed profiles on 40,000 firms and over two million professionals. Dakota Marketplace RIAs: Trusted by over 800 investment firms, Dakota RIA Database includes a curated list of 2,500+ RIAs and over 5,000 Broker Dealer teams that are confirmed to use outside managers with over 100+ investment preferences.

# article_298_the-top-10-holders-of-values-etfs

{'title': 'The Top 10 Holders of Values ETFs', 'introduction': 'Passive ownership of the S&P 500 has doubled in the past seven years, with 21% of market capitalization of the average company now in passive ETFs and funds. Yes, that means passive investors now own a fifth of each company in the S&P 500. When looking at the sub-asset classes, the top five companies in the Russell 1000 Growth index make up 40% of the index. Compare this to the Russell 1000 Value index where the top five holdings makeup only 11% of the index. The positive is that broad indexing is certainly resonating with investors. The negatives are the inefficiencies created with stock prices being more inelastic to supply and demand in both directions and the impact that market cap weighting has had. We have clearly seen this on display during 2020-2021, as growth stocks were outperforming all other styles and factors. One example is Tesla rising over 700% in 2020 as it was added to the S&P500, making its market cap worth more than the combined value of the nine largest traditional automakers globally. Now in 2022, this growth outperformance and subsequent mega-cap growth weighting is working in reverse as the extended valuations normalize. At the close of May, growth investments had unraveled against the backdrop of persistently high inflation, and an abruptly hawkish Federal Reserve. At the same time, the S&P 500 Pure Value Index is up nearly 5%, outperforming the S&P 500 by 18%, and outperforming its pure growth equivalent by 27% year-to-date ending 5/31/22. (source: Morningstar 6/2/2022) In this article, we’re sharing the trends we’ve been seeing, as well as the top ten holders of Values ETFs in 2022 so far. First, we’ll jump into the trends we’ve found among the 13F data within Dakota Marketplace. From a flow perspective, our 13F data showed us that much of the groundwork was being laid before this performance shift. Three main things jump started the flows we saw among allocators at the beginning of Q3 last year: the end of near zero rates and down trend in bond yields inflation began to resurface as our economy reopened last year many of the sectors within value have strong current cash flows, and investors began to place a higher level of importance on current cash and the ability to raise prices VS the promise of future cash flows The combination of these factors caused allocators to shift into the value ETF space at the fastest pace we have seen since 2018. High-level, we saw over a 400% increase in ETF flows from Q3 to Q4 into value. This moderated from Q4 2021-Q1 2022 to a 67% gain, which is still massive.  Peeling this back a bit, the areas in value which attracted the most were mid cap value and SMID value as opposed to large cap… more than likely given their operating leverage that allocators were looking for and many commodity related companies reside in these market caps In terms of product style, ETFs which had exposure to the value factor and funds which focused on dividends/cash flows were also favored as the MP data showed us, among other smart beta strategies which focused on cash flows. While we have seen fits/starts in the rotation into value among allocators over the past decade, and fits and starts in value outperformance over growth, does anything make this rotation more durable?  From what allocators are saying, yes, as they point to two main themes: The days of nominal zero rates are a thing of the past for now and that inflation could stay elevated for a while, both of which create a tailwind for value. Less of a value VS growth conversation for them these days, but more of owning both.  It is not that value’s performance has been horrible over the trailing 10 years, it is more that growth has outperformed that much more on a relative basis and now those tailwinds are fading. This chart from Touchstone gives us a nice historical look that even after the value catch up we have had to grow over the past quarter or so, we still have some room to go to get to the average VS growth. Next we’ll outline the top ten Value ETF holders so far in 2022. The Sade Group Private Wealth Management: $5,917,000,000 (49,460 shares  iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF) The Sade Group Private Wealth Management: $5,357,000,000 (94,801 shares FlexShares Quality Dividend Defensv ETF) Bank of America Merrill Lynch: $5,238,758,000 (31,562,588 shares iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF) Morgan Stanley: $4,901,576,000 (29,531,123 shares iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF) The Sade Group Private Wealth Management: $4,461,000,000 (160,059 shares First Trust SMID Cp Rising Div Achv ETF) The Sade Group Private Wealth Management: $3,999,000,000 (56,714 shares First Trust Large Cap Val AlphaDEX® ETF) The Sade Group Private Wealth Management: $3,563,000,000 (70,099 shares Fidelity® Value Factor ETF) The Sade Group Private Wealth Management: $2,904,000,000 (42,944 shares Vanguard Intl Hi Div Yld Idx) Envestnet: $2,680,098,000 (53,324,662 shares iShares MSCI EAFE Value Index) J.P.

Three main things jump started the flows we saw among allocators at the beginning of Q3 last year: the end of near zero rates and down trend in bond yields inflation began to resurface as our economy reopened last year many of the sectors within value have strong current cash flows, and investors began to place a higher level of importance on current cash and the ability to raise prices VS the promise of future cash flows The combination of these factors caused allocators to shift into the value ETF space at the fastest pace we have seen since 2018. High-level, we saw over a 400% increase in ETF flows from Q3 to Q4 into value. This moderated from Q4 2021-Q1 2022 to a 67% gain, which is still massive.  Peeling this back a bit, the areas in value which attracted the most were mid cap value and SMID value as opposed to large cap… more than likely given their operating leverage that allocators were looking for and many commodity related companies reside in these market caps In terms of product style, ETFs which had exposure to the value factor and funds which focused on dividends/cash flows were also favored as the MP data showed us, among other smart beta strategies which focused on cash flows. While we have seen fits/starts in the rotation into value among allocators over the past decade, and fits and starts in value outperformance over growth, does anything make this rotation more durable?  From what allocators are saying, yes, as they point to two main themes: The days of nominal zero rates are a thing of the past for now and that inflation could stay elevated for a while, both of which create a tailwind for value. Less of a value VS growth conversation for them these days, but more of owning both.  It is not that value’s performance has been horrible over the trailing 10 years, it is more that growth has outperformed that much more on a relative basis and now those tailwinds are fading. This chart from Touchstone gives us a nice historical look that even after the value catch up we have had to grow over the past quarter or so, we still have some room to go to get to the average VS growth. Next we’ll outline the top ten Value ETF holders so far in 2022. The Sade Group Private Wealth Management: $5,917,000,000 (49,460 shares  iShares Russell Mid-Cap Value ETF) The Sade Group Private Wealth Management: $5,357,000,000 (94,801 shares FlexShares Quality Dividend Defensv ETF) Bank of America Merrill Lynch: $5,238,758,000 (31,562,588 shares iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF) Morgan Stanley: $4,901,576,000 (29,531,123 shares iShares Russell 1000 Value ETF) The Sade Group Private Wealth Management: $4,461,000,000 (160,059 shares First Trust SMID Cp Rising Div Achv ETF) The Sade Group Private Wealth Management: $3,999,000,000 (56,714 shares First Trust Large Cap Val AlphaDEX® ETF) The Sade Group Private Wealth Management: $3,563,000,000 (70,099 shares Fidelity® Value Factor ETF) The Sade Group Private Wealth Management: $2,904,000,000 (42,944 shares Vanguard Intl Hi Div Yld Idx) Envestnet: $2,680,098,000 (53,324,662 shares iShares MSCI EAFE Value Index) J.P.

# article_237_may-2023-public-plan-commitment-summary

{'title': 'May 2023 Public Plan Commitment Summary', 'introduction': 'The month of May saw: Subdued markets in May led to a small increase in funded status from 74.5% to 74.8% according to Milliman. The biggest observation has been less volatility across fixed income sub-asset classes and guessing where monetary policy may go. As we noted last month, tighter lending conditions via the banks have now opened opportunities for private credit and private real estate lending to step in as many managers have been purchasing these loans at attractive levels from the banks. May was a meaningfully busier month as commitments made totaled $15.6 B allocated among 109 individual managers. There were no terminations and 48 individual pension funds made commitments during the month. The top allocations during the month were: Washington State Investment Board allocating $2.5 billion Florida State Board of Administration allocating $1.7 billion New Jersey Division of Investment allocating $1.275 billion Indiana Public Retirement System allocating $1.235 billion Asset Classes: May was an about face in terms of where allocators committed capital with Private Equity taking in 60% of commitments, Private Credit maintained second with 20% of commitments, and Real Assets also maintained its spot in the top three taking 7% of commitments. It is also worth mentioning that Fixed Income took in 4% this month, a reflection of the higher yields present today VS a year ago. Sub Asset Classes: flowing down from PE being the largest asset class, Middle Market Buyout the largest sub-asset allocation taking in 18% of commitments, in second Large Buyout took in 14% of allocations, and Growth Equity also took in 14% of commitments in third place. Worth a mention that the Direct Lending sub-asset class came into the top five for the first time in a year it is taking the place of traditional lending sources. While we sound like a broken record, VC maintains a spot also in the top five, as the allocators remain committed to innovation and growth deposit what we are reading in the headlines. There were over 33 sub-asset classes allocated to this month, which is higher than average. Looking at the top shifts made this month: Washington State Investment Board allocated $750 M to the Hellman & Friedman Capital Partners XI (11) large buyout fund, another $750 M to the TA XV ( 15) growth equity buyout fund, and $400 M to the Searchlight Capital IV middle market buyout. Florida State Board of Administration allocated $300 M to Loomis Core Plus Fixed Income and another $300 M to Manulife Core Plus Fixed Income confirming that pension allocators are more comfortable adding traditional Agg exposure again, and lastly $200M to Sprott Private Resource Lending III and another $200 M H.I.G. White Horse FSBA both of which are Direct Lending funds. New Jersey Division of Investment allocated $350M to HPS Investment Partners direct lending SMA, $250 M to CVC Capital Partners IX large buyout, and another $200 M to HPS Investment Partners Co-Invest direct lending fund. One item of note is that we continue to see the Hedge Fund asset class struggle to attract allocations this year. But as allocators continue to tell us during the Dakota Live segments, always stay in front of allocators with ideas so when the market turns another direction, they are familiar with your strategy. CLOs are a great example of this as a year ago the segment failed to attract interest yet in 2023 is in the top 10 each month now.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'May 2023 Public Plan Commitment Summary', 'content': 'The month of May saw: Subdued markets in May led to a small increase in funded status from 74.5% to 74.8% according to Milliman.

{'title': 'Investment Industry Trends to Watch in 2022', 'introduction': "The start of a new year, especially one that marks the start of our third year of a pandemic, can be unpredictable. It’s safe to say that no one can quite predict what’s coming next with the industry, the markets, or our own day to day lives, for that matter. But over the last three years, we’ve all become accustomed to adapting — and adapting again — and again as the need arises. Here at Dakota, we’ve made it our goal to be the go-to resource for investment sales professionals, whether that's through our database platform, our educational resources, or our weekly Dakota Live! Calls. We know there’s an overwhelming sense of news fatigue by now, a saturation of “Trends” and “What to Expect” pieces that have flooded our inboxes. This is why we’ve run through them all for you. In this article, we’re going to walk you through eight investment industry trends for 2022. By the end of the article, you’ll have a better sense of what you need to keep an eye on, and what might be coming to an end this year. 1. The efficacy of bonds will remain in question With bonds still offering low yields and negative real-rates, and public equities providing exceptional returns since the onset of the pandemic, many pension funds are trying to lock in their gains as they’ve reached fully-funded status. Despite the unattractive valuations of bonds, pensions simply want to match their expected liabilities without risk, becoming a valuation agonistic buyer.   Then the question becomes: what do you do if they’re not at that fully-funded status? For non-pension fund allocators, making a bond allocation is an active choice within port construction and IPS creation. Historically bonds provided a portfolio buffer in times of volatility and a source of income. In 2021 however, bonds gave us a taste of what to expect when inflation, which has not been present for years, and the FED signals an unwind of massive stimulus. The asset class failed to provide income above the rate of inflation, nor did it provide a buffer during yield backups that caused equity volatility. While likely a temporary phenomenon, it will not be easy to time when bonds have cleared the inflation and QE unwind. 2. Public pension funds will continue offloading their risks to insurance companies Currently, larger companies are offloading their pension risks to insurance companies to get rid of their liabilities and have offloaded these balance sheet risks. Now, Instead of trying to sell directly to pension fund CIOs and their consultants, managers are going to need to get in front of insurance companies that now own these assets as need to smooth out expected returns for future retirees will continue. 3. We’ll see more RIA roll ups and consolidations We can’t be sure when this pattern of mergers and consolidations will end. The question becomes: How do you know when it’s time to go it alone, Partner up with a larger mega RIA, or when it’s the right time to sell? RIAs are valued at a multiple of their revenue, and their revenue is based on assets. If the market takes a hit, does that hurt RIA valuations, and how does an RIA make the right choice? Do you sell while the are markets high, access to capital for potential acquirers is abundant, and get a big pay day? This trend is likely going to continue as long as RIAs enjoy relatively high asset levels and consolidation offers economies of scale for “mega RIAs’. 4. Bringing alternatives to retail investors will continue to grow With interest rates at historically low levels, duration extended for many fixed income asset classes, and equities on the higher end of valuations,  it will be difficult for advisers to construct efficient 60/40 portfolios. As advisers seek to buy or allocate to alternatives, the question becomes: who is the go to? What is the right alternative? We’ve seen this leading to firms democratizing alternatives, broadening out the distribution of the asset class  and mixing them into portfolio construction built for today’s environment. 5. The fight for industry talent will continue Stemming from the 2008 market crash, the investment and financial industry talent pool has been scarce, with younger talent being attracted to new industries post GFC, and  a high turnover rate to coincide with that. Going into 2022, we are likely to continue to see this fight for good talent continue as the world contends with the “great resignation” and the “great reorganization.” 6. Concerns about inflation could continue to grow While this has been an ongoing concern for many over the last year or so, it is unknown whether inflation will continue to rise, creating concern, or will gradually come down and start to ease. This could result in prices continuing to climb, or a price reduction and an inventory glut as things slowly proceed back to normal. It will be crucial for allocators to understand how inflation, and what type  of inflation impacts their client and then how to gain exposure to that inflation threat.  A trucking or airline company may need to protect themselves from a rise in fuel costs, while a retiree’s biggest concern may be healthcare costs. 7. ETF product launches may see a decline The last few years have seen a record number of ETF product launches. The problem with this is that these products have been launched without much (if any) demand taking the approach of “build it and they will come”.  This has resulted in 1 in 20 of those products being delisted quickly. The answer here could be mutual funds, SMAs, UCITS and model delivery which require less activity, and allows more control of the owners who issue the strategy.  Flows continue to favor low cost beta exposure to indices with over one third of 2021 flows going into these index tracking products. 8. People may start to rethink owning credit as an asset class Because investors and many central banks for that matter don’t know the, end point of interest rates, bank loans, CLOs, and anything with a variable rate/short duration may continue to be a popular asset class. This could lead to asset classes like private credit, CLOs, and bank loans getting major flows as investors try to generate income while trying rid duration which can be a headwind as yields increase. What does this mean for you? While this list is designed to give you an overview of trends we’ll be keeping our eye on this year, as we mentioned above, nothing can be known for sure, and we’ll continue to monitor these things as the year progresses. The best course of action is to continue to monitor these trends, and try to focus on the things you can control. No one can control the markets, or inflation and interest rates, but you can focus on attracting and retaining great talent, and ensuring that your firm is well staffed for the time ahead. You can also make sure you have the best training and resources possible for your team, so that you’re always up to date on current events, trends, and more.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'Investment Industry Trends to Watch in 2022', 'content': "The start of a new year, especially one that marks the start of our third year of a pandemic, can be unpredictable.

But over the last three years, we’ve all become accustomed to adapting — and adapting again — and again as the need arises.
