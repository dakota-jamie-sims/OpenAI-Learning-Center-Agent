{'title': 'What Portfolio Companies Can Do For Your Private Equity Firm', 'introduction': "In the competitive world of private equity, where timing and data accuracy are paramount, access to comprehensive and precise information often determines whether you secure or lose a valuable deal. Portfolio companies are the key assets that drive growth, enable strategic initiatives, and ultimately generate the returns that define the success of the private equity firm. By leveraging a robust portfolio company database like Dakota Marketplace, your firm can significantly enhance its ability to identify investment opportunities and confidently execute strategic deals. In this blog, we explore the critical benefits of utilizing a portfolio company database and how it can improve your investment sourcing and monitoring efforts. By the end, you’ll gain actionable insights into leveraging Dakota Marketplace’s comprehensive database to optimize deal sourcing, streamline decision-making processes, and drive superior returns for your firm. Critical Benefits of Accessing a Portfolio Company Database A portfolio company database is an indispensable resource for private equity firms, enhancing deal sourcing and streamlining the due diligence process. With detailed company profiles, key contacts, sponsor information, and M&A history, this type of database helps firms quickly identify and evaluate new investment opportunities, making the due diligence process faster and more efficient. Additionally, a portfolio company database offers valuable insights into the competitive landscape, allowing firms to track the strategic moves of competitors and understand market dynamics within industry groups. This information helps private equity firms anticipate shifts in the market, optimize their investment strategies, and stay ahead of the competition. Finally, a portfolio company database can aid in relationship management and strategic planning by providing detailed information on key personnel and ongoing performance tracking of portfolio companies. This ensures that investments are aligned with the firm's growth objectives and supports better exit strategies, ultimately driving superior returns. Maximizing the Value of Portfolio Company Data Leveraging a portfolio company database effectively means capitalizing on the rich information it offers to make more strategic, informed investment decisions. Thorough due diligence is at the heart of this process. By deeply understanding the company and the broader competitive landscape, firms can avoid potential risks and strategically capitalize on opportunities that align with their growth objectives. For deal sourcing, a portfolio company database allows private equity firms to filter and customize searches based on specific criteria such as industry, geography, or company size. This targeted approach ensures that private equity professionals are focusing their efforts on the most relevant opportunities, maximizing efficiency and effectiveness in their investment processes. Additionally, having access to detailed information on the key personnel involved in portfolio companies such as CEOs, board members, and deal professionals enables firms to build relationships with the correct key contacts that can lead to future deals and partnerships. Furthermore, the ability to monitor market trends through a portfolio company database allows firms to be in the know of when private equity firms may be looking to sell their companies, and time outreach accurately.

# article_195_5-key-features-to-the-marketplace-for-salesforce-i

{'title': '5 Key Features to the Marketplace for Salesforce Integration', 'introduction': 'There are many issues that arise from adopting and implementing a new CRM, like Salesforce, at your firm. From resistance, to users not logging in, to failed implementations, it comes down to having a proper configuration of your Salesforce instance. Configuring and customizing your team’s Salesforce instance is high in opportunity cost and actual cash spent on getting your instance setup. Custom Salesforce Developers lack the domain expertise in the investment management industry to properly set-up and configure a Salesforce instance for fundraising teams. This is why we created the Dakota Salesforce App, which integrates all of the Dakota Marketplace functionality with our customers Salesforce.com instance. It solves all of these issues for you and your team in order to 10x your productivity, streamlining your fundraising. In this article, we’re giving you five key features to our Salesforce App Integration. By the end of this article, you’ll have a clear understanding of these features and why our Salesforce App Integration solves every problem an investment firm and their database administrators face on a daily basis with Salesforce. 1. Sharing The first feature of the Marketplace for Salesforce App Integration to note is the sharing feature. With this, you have the ability to share records with colleagues at your firm who have licenses to Dakota Marketplace. This includes sharing information in retrospect to accounts, contacts, investments, and our fundraising news feed. 2. Metro Areas The metro area feature is one that users of Dakota Marketplace enjoy so much, that we included it within the Salesforce App Integration. This metro area tab allows users to focus on one metro area through breaking it down by potential prospects and firms within the desired area. This makes the daunting task of prospecting all RIAs in the USA a lot simpler to handle. With the Salesforce App Integration, you can efficiently schedule meetings with the Map It feature, allowing you to see any desired channel in whichever metro. This leaves room to book additional meetings, identify firms that allocate to your type of investment strategy, and connect with due diligence professionals that sit remotely within a given city. 3. Following The following feature is something that we pride ourselves on within our Salesforce integration. You will be able to follow accounts and contacts from several locations such as the Homepage within your Salesforce instance and the metro area tab. On the contact level, users of the Marketplace for Salesforce integration will receive notifications when a followed contact has a job or role change. As for the account level, they will receive notifications if any contact at the firm has a job or role change, if there are updates to the account, anytime the firm’s consultant changes, and whenever a public investment has been added to Marketplace. 4. Alerts on Job / Role Changes Another feature to note on the Marketplace for Salesforce App Integration is the job and role change alerts. This gives you the capability to receive alerts on job and role changes, allowing you to remain up to date on movement occurring within the investment field. On average, there are seven a day being reported in Marketplace. These will be pushed right to your inbox to ensure you are reaching out to the correct people, at the right firm. 5. Home Page The fifth feature we will review may be the most important - the Marketplace for Salesforce App Integration home page will be the same as the Marketplace home page. This is critical for a plethora of reasons, but let’s start with the main one - no need to configure or customize your Salesforce instance! The Marketplace home page is customized by fundraisers themselves who are out raising money, just like you. On the home page you’ll find several dashboards including job and role changes, as well as fundraising news. Both of these will keep you up to date with industry turnover in addition to valuable trends. We highlighted job and role changes above, however, with the fundraising news you can stay informed on recent commitments, new searches, personnel updates, manager presentations, and more within the LP space. In addition, there’s another dashboard for new investments, new accounts, and new contacts.  Our data team is adding several of these daily in order to provide a curated set of information for you and your team to help streamline your fundraising.

# article_090_dakota-fund-tracker-week-of-9-2-2024

This blog delivers critical insights into the latest trends within the investment landscape, offering a comprehensive overview of where capital is flowing and which sectors are gaining momentum. This week, several new funds have been launched, reflecting a wide range of asset classes and strategies. Below, we’ll discuss the trends across asset classes, industries, and geographic focus. In this article, we’ll give you a breakdown overview of these new funds, and a highlight into trends across asset classes and the industry. Asset Class Trends: Private Equity: Private equity continues to dominate fundraising activity, with a variety of strategies being pursued, including growth equity, middle-market buyouts, and co-investments. Many of the new private equity funds are focusing on sectors such as technology, healthcare, and consumer products. These industries remain attractive due to their strong growth potential and resilience. For example, Platinum GSM Outdoors Principals Fund is targeting middle-market buyouts in consumer goods, while Ares Insurance PE Secondaries Fund III LP reflects growing interest in the secondary private equity market, which provides investors with liquidity opportunities in the space. Venture Capital: Venture capital funds are also highly active, focusing on early-stage investments in sectors driving innovation. Key areas of interest include fintech, digital infrastructure, and artificial intelligence. The Shamrock ND Holdco, L.P. fund, for instance, is targeting technology investments with a focus on scalable startups. Venture capital continues to seize opportunities in tech-driven sectors that promise high growth and potential market disruption. Private Real Estate: Private real estate funds remain a significant part of the new fund landscape, with a focus on both opportunistic and value-add strategies. Many of these funds are targeting commercial and residential properties, particularly in major metropolitan areas. The Investcorp US Real Estate Employee Co-Investment Fund is an example of a fund targeting stabilized real estate assets in key urban centers, reflecting investor interest in long-term, stable income from real estate investments. Private Credit: Private credit is seeing consistent interest, with new funds primarily focused on direct lending, distressed credit, and structured credit strategies. These funds are targeting middle-market lending opportunities and providing capital to companies seeking alternative financing solutions. Ares Global Structured Solutions LP is an example of a private credit fund designed to offer more flexible lending options, particularly in the mid-market space, where traditional financing is harder to secure. Hedge Funds: Hedge funds continue to launch, with a focus on strategies like long/short equity and global macro approaches. These funds are looking to capitalize on market volatility by making tactical bets on equities, currencies, and macroeconomic trends. For example, the Light Street Capital Global Macro Fund is employing a macro strategy that aims to navigate fluctuations in global markets while targeting sectors such as technology and financials, which are experiencing rapid change. Private Infrastructure: Private infrastructure is seeing targeted interest, with new funds focusing on both renewable energy and traditional energy projects. Shamrock Capital Advisors’ Infrastructure Fund is an example of a fund targeting renewable energy assets, aligning with the broader ESG trend. At the same time, traditional energy infrastructure projects, such as pipelines and utilities, remain attractive for their stability and essential role in supporting the global economy. Industry Trends: Technology: Technology remains one of the most prominent sectors for new funds, with investments targeting areas such as fintech, digital infrastructure, and software. As digital transformation continues to reshape industries, funds are increasingly looking for opportunities in emerging technologies like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and blockchain. The Shamrock ND Holdco, L.P. fund, for example, is backing companies at the cutting edge of tech innovation, positioning itself to capitalize on long-term growth trends in digital markets. Consumer: Consumer-facing industries are seeing significant interest from investors, particularly in sectors like healthcare, fintech, and media. Funds like Platinum GSM Outdoors Principals Fund are positioning themselves to benefit from shifting consumer preferences, especially as digitalization continues to influence how consumers engage with products and services. This trend highlights the importance of innovation in addressing evolving consumer needs, whether through personalized services or tech-driven solutions. Industrial & Manufacturing: The industrial and manufacturing sectors are also capturing investor attention, with funds targeting areas like aerospace & defense, transportation, and logistics. Ares Insurance PE Secondaries Fund III LP, for example, is seeking opportunities in sectors that are vital to modern infrastructure. As global economies adapt to supply chain disruptions and infrastructure needs, these industries are positioned for future growth and transformation. Geographic Distribution: This week’s new funds reflect a strong focus on North America, particularly the U.S. and Canada. However, there is also significant interest in global markets, as many funds are looking beyond traditional geographies to tap into opportunities in Europe, Asia, and the Middle East. Some funds are even targeting a broader range of regions, including Africa, Australia, and South America, reflecting the trend toward geographic diversification. Investors are increasingly looking to mitigate regional risks and capture growth across both developed and emerging markets, positioning themselves for long-term success in a dynamic global economy. The New Funds Tracker blog provides a snapshot of the latest trends shaping the investment landscape. This week’s new fund launches reflect a diverse and dynamic investment landscape, with strong interest in private equity and venture capital, particularly in technology and consumer sectors. Private real estate and private credit continue to play essential roles, while hedge funds and private infrastructure are targeting niche opportunities in volatile and essential markets.

{'title': 'The Top 10 RIAs in Secondary Cities', 'introduction': "Imagine it: your boss tells you you need to start doing outreach in the RIA channel because it's a large, untapped market for your firm. While it’s an exciting opportunity, it’s also overwhelming, because it’s so large. In fact, as of July 2022, the SEC database lists that there are currently 15,239 RIAs that you could be calling on. How do you cut that list down? How do you know which ones are best to call on?

We’ve used that expertise to build out our RIA database within Dakota Marketplace, our institutional investor database of curated RIA firms.

{'title': 'Creating Videos Of Your Portfolio Managers: 3 Tips For Videos Your Sales Team Will Actually Use', 'introduction': "In a world without in-person meetings, you’ve likely already been told how important it is to incorporate video into your sales and marketing strategies. And while it’s true that video is key to setting the stage for building relationships with allocators and due diligence analysts, all video is not created equal, especially when it comes to investment firms. At the end of the day, the videos you create are only useful if they are being used by your sales team to share information about your firm with analysts. However, in our experience, this is not often the case. Typically video is being created and then left untouched, despite the firm making a significant investment in its production. We get it. You know you need to be shooting video and incorporating it into your strategy, and so, like many firms, you find a videographer and do just that. This often results in beautifully shot videos of your building, lobby, and team... without very much substance to work with. This is because — understandably — most videographers don’t know the questions investment allocators want answered, and you’re left with videos that are nicely made but of little use to your sales team. To help remedy this, we’re going to break down three key tips for successful videos for your investment firms. We know exactly what due diligence analysts want to know, and we want to help set you up for success. At Dakota, we started shooting videos of the managers we raise money for in 2017 to solve one key problem: to provide our sales team with another way to get due diligence analysts to connect with our Portfolio Managers. We use a simple video link in an email. It’s been incredibly successful and our team uses these video links in emails all the time to introduce our investment strategies to analysts. We believe so much in the power of video that we created Dakota Studios to help us and others shoot professional videos that investment sales teams will use. By the end of this article, you’ll know exactly what should be included in a video about your firm, allowing you to create digital assets that your sales team will use to better connect with allocators. 1. Prepare to be on camera with clear, templated outlines of the questions you'll be answering Your videos aren’t being used because they aren’t answering the right questions. To fix this, you need to define what those questions are, and outline the answers to them. This will help you collect your thoughts, and plan what to say before the camera starts rolling. Each video should have a purpose, whether that’s to introduce your firm, give an overview of your strategy, or explain your portfolio construction process. Having a clear plan for each video keeps you focused, organized, and ensures that you’re covering the exact topics a due diligence analyst wants answered. Think of it as being in a pitch meeting — without the meeting. These templates can also be used to practice what will be said in each video, and can be done interview-style so that when you do start filming, you’re at ease and as prepared as possible when the camera starts rolling. 2. Make sure your audience knows exactly what questions you’re answering This simple pre-production tip may feel insignificant, but we’ve found that it can make all the difference to the viewer to know exactly what question you are answering. It’s critical that you’re speaking clearly throughout the video, and stating the question being answered at the beginning of each video. This allows the viewer to know the question being answered, and will help keep things organized, especially if you’re sending due diligence analysts a series of videos. This is a subtle nuance that can be extremely important in getting your point across correctly. 3. Use voice overs to introduce each video Once it’s time for post-production, you’ll want to insert images and data that illustrate your points. However, don’t let these speak for themselves. To get the maximum impact from your viewers, have someone on your team do voice overs as needed, explaining what is being presented and answered. While it may seem that these pre- and post-production elements are extremely nuanced and small, it gets them engaged and allows them to come away with the correct takeaways. Putting it into practice Creating videos about your investment firm can feel like a daunting task, and an expensive one at that. But, after helping our salespeople successfully incorporate video into their sales strategy, we can say with confidence that using video will make a difference. So, how do you get started shooting video for your investment team when we’ve already told you that most videographers get it wrong? Start by defining the questions due diligence analysts want answered. What areas do your salespeople spend the most time explaining? Start with the questions and answers, because, at the end of the day, no one knows your firm and your strategy better than the people in it. Determine your budget. On average, video production can run anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000. The question becomes: are the resulting videos going to be of use to your sales team? Over the last five years, we’ve learned that it’s incredibly easy to make mistakes that render your videos useless, leaving you out a significant amount of money, with videos salespeople won’t use. However, we think the above tips will help prevent any of that, and will result in videos your sales team will be excited to use to prospect for new meetings with analysts. Why? Because they answer the questions allocators want answered. If you want to start shooting video and aren’t sure where to get started, our team is here to help. With years of experience shooting video for investment firms of varying sizes, we’ve recently launched Dakota Studios, a world-class space designed to help investment sales teams create digital assets that they will use to get due diligence analysts to better connect with your firm and your Portfolio Managers. We wanted to be able to easily shoot videos on a more consistent basis so we created an ESPN-like studio in downtown Philadelphia to do just that. It’s now very easy for us to shoot all kinds of videos and we’ve opened it up to other investment firms to have their videos shot for their salespeople to use. If you want to learn more about exactly what should be included in videos for your sales team, you can check out this article that outlines exactly that. If you’re ready to start shooting impactful video for your team, we’d love to set up a video consultation and schedule a time to shoot your videos in our studio, where we’ll not only edit and produce your videos, but coach you through each question with a member of our investment sales team.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'Creating Videos Of Your Portfolio Managers: 3 Tips For Videos Your Sales Team Will Actually Use', 'content': "In a world without in-person meetings, you’ve likely already been told how important it is to incorporate video into your sales and marketing strategies.

We know exactly what due diligence analysts want to know, and we want to help set you up for success. At Dakota, we started shooting videos of the managers we raise money for in 2017 to solve one key problem: to provide our sales team with another way to get due diligence analysts to connect with our Portfolio Managers. We use a simple video link in an email. It’s been incredibly successful and our team uses these video links in emails all the time to introduce our investment strategies to analysts. We believe so much in the power of video that we created Dakota Studios to help us and others shoot professional videos that investment sales teams will use. By the end of this article, you’ll know exactly what should be included in a video about your firm, allowing you to create digital assets that your sales team will use to better connect with allocators. 1. Prepare to be on camera with clear, templated outlines of the questions you'll be answering Your videos aren’t being used because they aren’t answering the right questions. To fix this, you need to define what those questions are, and outline the answers to them. This will help you collect your thoughts, and plan what to say before the camera starts rolling. Each video should have a purpose, whether that’s to introduce your firm, give an overview of your strategy, or explain your portfolio construction process. Having a clear plan for each video keeps you focused, organized, and ensures that you’re covering the exact topics a due diligence analyst wants answered. Think of it as being in a pitch meeting — without the meeting. These templates can also be used to practice what will be said in each video, and can be done interview-style so that when you do start filming, you’re at ease and as prepared as possible when the camera starts rolling. 2. Make sure your audience knows exactly what questions you’re answering This simple pre-production tip may feel insignificant, but we’ve found that it can make all the difference to the viewer to know exactly what question you are answering. It’s critical that you’re speaking clearly throughout the video, and stating the question being answered at the beginning of each video. This allows the viewer to know the question being answered, and will help keep things organized, especially if you’re sending due diligence analysts a series of videos. This is a subtle nuance that can be extremely important in getting your point across correctly. 3. Use voice overs to introduce each video Once it’s time for post-production, you’ll want to insert images and data that illustrate your points. However, don’t let these speak for themselves. To get the maximum impact from your viewers, have someone on your team do voice overs as needed, explaining what is being presented and answered. While it may seem that these pre- and post-production elements are extremely nuanced and small, it gets them engaged and allows them to come away with the correct takeaways. Putting it into practice Creating videos about your investment firm can feel like a daunting task, and an expensive one at that. But, after helping our salespeople successfully incorporate video into their sales strategy, we can say with confidence that using video will make a difference. So, how do you get started shooting video for your investment team when we’ve already told you that most videographers get it wrong? Start by defining the questions due diligence analysts want answered. What areas do your salespeople spend the most time explaining? Start with the questions and answers, because, at the end of the day, no one knows your firm and your strategy better than the people in it. Determine your budget. On average, video production can run anywhere from $5,000 to $15,000. The question becomes: are the resulting videos going to be of use to your sales team? Over the last five years, we’ve learned that it’s incredibly easy to make mistakes that render your videos useless, leaving you out a significant amount of money, with videos salespeople won’t use. However, we think the above tips will help prevent any of that, and will result in videos your sales team will be excited to use to prospect for new meetings with analysts. Why? Because they answer the questions allocators want answered. If you want to start shooting video and aren’t sure where to get started, our team is here to help. With years of experience shooting video for investment firms of varying sizes, we’ve recently launched Dakota Studios, a world-class space designed to help investment sales teams create digital assets that they will use to get due diligence analysts to better connect with your firm and your Portfolio Managers. We wanted to be able to easily shoot videos on a more consistent basis so we created an ESPN-like studio in downtown Philadelphia to do just that. It’s now very easy for us to shoot all kinds of videos and we’ve opened it up to other investment firms to have their videos shot for their salespeople to use. If you want to learn more about exactly what should be included in videos for your sales team, you can check out this article that outlines exactly that. If you’re ready to start shooting impactful video for your team, we’d love to set up a video consultation and schedule a time to shoot your videos in our studio, where we’ll not only edit and produce your videos, but coach you through each question with a member of our investment sales team.", 'bullet_points': [], 'subsections': []}], 'key_takeaways': [], 'faqs': []}

# article_248_3-ways-to-make-the-most-of-your-dakota-marketplace

{'title': '3 Ways to Make the Most of Your Dakota Marketplace Free Trial', 'introduction': 'As a busy salesperson, it’s one thing to sign up for a free trial for a new database platform, but another thing entirely to have the time to explore it properly before your trial ends. However, it’s also true that the best way to make sure a new data platform is right for you is by really taking the time to dig into the new platform to see all of the features and ways it can benefit you and your team. As data providers ourselves here at Dakota, we’ve seen firsthand how challenging it can be to implement a new system, especially one as integral as an institutional investor database, or other software platform. One key way to ensure a successful implementation or data platform change is to put your new platform through the ringer during your free trial, and act as if you’re really traveling to, setting up meetings with the accounts and contacts within the platform. In this article, we’re going to be outlining 3 ways to get the most out of your Dakota Marketplace free trial. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear path forward, so that you can make the best decision for your firm. We’ll be covering: Looking through accounts The importance of setting aside time for key players to review the platform Keeping an eye on responsiveness 1. Look at at least 20 accounts This might feel like a huge number, but if you’re going to be bringing on a new data platform, you’ll be using it to look at far more than 20 accounts if you decide to move forward, and it’s better to know up front what kind of data is inside the platform, how accurate and up-to-date it is, and how easy it is to find. A database should be working for you, not the other way around, so if it’s difficult to navigate the platform to the information you need, or the information you find is out of date, chances are, it’s the wrong fit for your firm. At Dakota, we encourage free trial users to look at at least 20 accounts. Not the accounts you know like the back of your hand, but a large sample of firms across the country, as if you’re planning a visit to a particular place and need to fill your day with meetings. This is the best way to get a feel for the breadth of information within the platform. Marketplace features to help you accomplish this: Map It and Custom Lists. 2. Set aside time for key stakeholders to review the platform If you’re the one on the team leading the effort to implement a new system, you likely already know what makes it great and different from what you have now. Now it’s time to get the rest of your team on board. This means understanding: What the solution provides across different datasets What you’re currently subscribed to Where you need gaps filled. Make sure that the key stakeholders within the different groups across the company know this information, and that insights gained throughout any free trials are understood and shared across the board. In this case it really is the more the merrier, because the more people who know about the new solution, the less convincing you’ll have to do down the line. 3. Take note of how responsive the platform’s team is This is important because the way you’re treated as a trial user is indicative of how you’ll be treated as a full user. If you have questions, corrections, or other concerns, how long does it take to get a reply from the customer success team? Not all customer success teams are created equal, and it’s not uncommon for this to take days, if not a week or more, before you see a reply. At Dakota, one of the things our members like best is our responsiveness. Our customer success team is available anytime you need them, whether you have a question, want to learn about best practices, or something else entirely. We also offer daily office hours that anyone can access to get their concerns addressed.

# article_066_mmi-annual-conference-highlights-navigating-the-fu

{'title': 'MMI Annual Conference Highlights: Navigating the Future of Wealth Management', 'introduction': "Attending investment industry conferences is more than just a chance to network; it's an opportunity to gain valuable insights, stay ahead of emerging trends, and build connections that can shape both individual careers and entire organizations. At Dakota, we know the impact of these events firsthand – our team regularly attends conferences like the MMI Annual Conference to stay attuned to industry shifts and bring back insights that fuel our approach to client success. This year’s MMI Annual Conference was no exception. Featuring an array of expert speakers and panels, the event provided a comprehensive look at pressing topics, from tax policy implications and AI advancements to the evolving demographics of advisors and investors. In this article, we’ve highlighted the most impactful takeaways from the conference, offering actionable advice for institutional investors, financial advisors, and wealth management firms alike. By the end, whether you’re navigating the complexities of tax changes, exploring AI's role in wealth management, or seeking strategies to engage a diverse client base, you’ll have insights to keep you informed and ready for the road ahead. Strategies and Trends Shaping Wealth Management Tax Policy and Client Impact: With the upcoming elections potentially affecting tax policy, advisors should be prepared to guide clients through these changes. Strategies such as charitable giving and opportunity zone investments could be beneficial, particularly as clients react differently based on income brackets and financial goals. Remote Work and Wholesaling Adaptation: The shift to hybrid work is expanding the reach of wholesalers and advisors into previously underserved regions, while maintaining in-office junior roles for skill-building. Successful relationship management now focuses on making meaningful introductions, understanding client behaviors, and creating memorable interactions. AI’s Role in Wealth Management: AI is quickly becoming a powerful tool for advisors, aiding in tasks like meeting prep and client engagement. While it provides efficiency, AI remains an assistant rather than a replacement, with human intuition and relationship-building still at the core of successful wealth management. Demographic Shifts: As Millennials, Gen Z, and women take a more prominent role as investors, wealth management teams are reassessing their demographics to better reflect and serve these groups. Women, in particular, are becoming significant referrers of new clients, driving firms to prioritize diversity and inclusivity in their advisor base. Consolidation in RIA and Private Equity Influence: The trend toward “mega teams” among RIAs highlights a shift toward fewer, stronger partnerships, often facilitated by private equity consolidation. While this strategy aims for cost efficiency and enhanced client trust, it also brings challenges in maintaining team culture and client alignment. Investment Product Trends: With the rise of actively managed ETFs and alternative investments, advisors are broadening their offerings to meet client demand for diverse and personalized options. Educating advisors on these newer products will be crucial as alternatives gain a larger share in client portfolios. Shaping the Path Forward The MMI Annual Conference highlighted an industry in transition, driven by technology, demographic shifts, and evolving client expectations. As tax policies, client relationships, and investment strategies evolve, advisors who stay adaptable and informed will be well-positioned to thrive.

# article_000_why-relationships-still-win-in-private-equity-the

{'title': 'Why Relationships Still Win in Private Equity: The City Scheduling Advantage', 'introduction': 'As a founder of a SaaS business I have spoken to many smart and talented private equity investors. A question emerged during an episode of Dakota Way Sales Coaching: ‘Do you think in-person versus Zoom is better?’ From an efficiency standpoint, Zoom is best, but for building relationships and winning business, in-person meetings win every time. I’ve had hundreds of calls and meetings with private equity firms; the most impactful were face-to-face. In an era dominated by AI, relationships built through in-person interactions are crucial. That’s why City Scheduling is so valuable to deal sourcing—it’s your system for building in-person relationships at scale. AI can help identify targets and automate outreach, but it can’t sit across from a founder and build trust. Trust, rapport and gut instinct still close deals, so the smartest thing a BD professional can do is get in the room, shake hands and have real conversations. City Scheduling is a tactical approach where you proactively book 4–6 meetings in one metro area on a single day. You meet with CEOs in person to hear their stories and build authentic relationships. Zoom is useful, but nothing beats face-to-face when it comes to building long‑term founder relationships. Face-to-face meetings win because founders want to know who they’re dealing with; they’re entrusting their life’s work, and being present shows you take that seriously. Trust is a human emotion built through listening, eye contact, tone and presence, not automation. And in an AI‑saturated world where founders receive templated emails from dozens of funds, showing up in person becomes your differentiator. Dakota Marketplace integrates City Scheduling by breaking down private companies by city, industry and sector, and providing key information such as revenue and CEO contacts. With filters by metro area, you can quickly identify prospects and line up meetings. By following the City Scheduling playbook—picking five high‑priority cities, blocking one day for each, emailing ~30 CEOs per city and running five cities at a time—you build a constant rhythm of outreach and travel. This framework matters because while every PE fund is becoming more efficient and every CRM is getting smarter, very few professionals consistently sit down with founders. City Scheduling turns face‑to‑face meetings into a systematic practice, giving you an edge when deals are on the line. In a world of machines, being the human who shows up, listens and builds a relationship is how you stand out, source better and win deals.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'Why Relationships Still Win in Private Equity: The City Scheduling Advantage', 'content': 'As a founder of a SaaS business I have spoken to many smart and talented private equity investors.

# article_296_2022-mid-year-etf-product-trends

{'title': '2022 Mid-Year ETF Product Trends', 'introduction': 'While global markets experienced varying degrees of asset class returns in the first half of 2022, ETF managers were active across the board in launching new funds across multiple asset classes. We also saw a fair share of ETF closures with 51 being liquidated to date. An observation of note was that over 15% of ETF closures this year were ESG related, with factor/smart beta ETFs experiencing the second largest percentage of closures that we have seen in several years. ETF launches have been fast and furious for the past decade now, and as the product continues to mature, many asset managers have been keen to remember that they do not control if an ETF gets delisted from the exchange as the listing is based on volume and assets VS a mutual fund where the board of that fund and proxy votes determine what occurs to mutual funds. Some observations from the ETFs launches in 2022 thus far: As of 7/31/2022 there have been 235 new ETF launches in 2022. 141 of the strategies launched were actively managed. This is both a function of continued conversion from fund to ETFs, and new fund launches.

{'title': 'Unlock More Meetings: Investment Sales Emails That Work', 'introduction': 'In the fast-paced world of investment sales, one thing remains crystal clear: You can’t raise money without first getting a meeting. Meetings are the backbone of capital raising, yet with inboxes overflowing, securing one isn’t as simple as it used to be. You\'re likely working with top-notch portfolio managers and sophisticated investors, people who are constantly bombarded with emails. So, how do you stand out? How do you ensure your email doesn’t get lost in the shuffle, but instead drives the recipient to hit “Reply”? The answer lies in the art of cold outreach. As we’ve mentioned before, the way to win with RIAs is cold outreach. Which is why having the right email is so important. In this article, we\'re going to outline how to craft an email designed to get a meeting. By the end of the article, you’ll know exactly what to include in the three parts to your email. Why Cold Outreach Matters in Investment Sales Cold outreach isn’t just an essential part of the job – it’s a lifeline for anyone in investment sales. The ability to connect with new prospects, build relationships, and expand your network relies heavily on your outreach efforts. A well-crafted email can be the difference between getting in front of a key decision-maker or being ignored altogether. Even though cold emails may feel daunting, they’re powerful tools when done right. They allow you to demonstrate your value, show respect for the recipient’s time, and most importantly, pave the way to new opportunities. The Email Formula That Works Every effective sales email contains three core elements: a strong subject line, a punchy body that communicates value, and a compelling call to action. Here’s how you can nail each of these components. 1. The Subject Line: Your Foot in the Door The subject line is your first (and sometimes only) chance to grab attention. Think of it as the hook – if it’s weak, your email won’t even get opened. But if it\'s sharp and to the point, you increase your chances of being noticed. For investment sales professionals, specificity is key. Instead of vague subject lines like “Looking to connect” or “Introduction,” go for something that immediately conveys purpose and urgency. For example, if you’ll be in New York on October 10th, your subject line might be: “Meeting Request: October 10th, 3:00 PM in NYC” This subject line works because it’s clear, direct, and shows that you have something specific in mind. 2. The Body: One Sentence, Big Impact Now that you’ve got their attention with a great subject line, your email’s body needs to deliver. But here’s where many sales professionals go wrong – they try to cram too much information into a single email. Long paragraphs about your firm’s history, performance metrics, and investment strategies won’t get read. Instead, focus on one concise, impactful sentence. This is what we call the "JP Morgan Private Bank test." Imagine the scenario: you’re delivering life-changing news to someone, and you need them to respond. Your sentence must be so compelling that it demands attention. For example: “Hi [Name], I’m [Your Name] with [Your Firm]. I’ll be in NYC on October 10th and would  love to discuss how our strategy can help enhance your portfolio’s performance in the market.” This sentence is short but loaded with value – it introduces who you are, why you’re reaching out, and hints at the benefit they’ll gain from meeting you. 3. The Call to Action: Close the Deal Your closing statement should be clear and leave no room for a simple "no." Vague requests like “Can we meet sometime next week?” leave too much ambiguity and often lead to dead ends. Instead, provide a specific date and time, but with flexibility. For example: “Can you meet on October 10th at 3:00 PM?” This approach gives them the chance to either confirm or suggest an alternative, keeping the conversation going and increasing your chances of securing a meeting. Make Every Email Count As an investment sales professional, your livelihood depends on your ability to book meetings with qualified buyers. Your emails are your first impression – make them count. Remember to: Prioritize the subject line: It\'s your best shot at getting noticed. Keep the body short and impactful: Say just enough to pique their interest and convey value. Use a specific call to action: Give them a reason to say yes. Ultimately, effective cold outreach comes down to respecting the recipient’s time while communicating the value you bring. The more you refine your approach, the more meetings you’ll book, and the more opportunities you’ll create. Put these tips into practice, and watch your meeting count soar.

# article_366_3-of-the-most-common-sales-myths-debunked

{'title': '3 of the Most Common Sales Myths Debunked', 'introduction': 'Another day goes by with minimal meetings set up for the future. You and your sales team are wondering what’s going on — maybe it’s something to do with the market or just something in the air. If this sounds like something you’ve experienced before, you’re not alone, and we’re here to fill you in on what’s actually going on. It’s very probable you and your team are caught up in one of the three sales common myths we’re going to talk about in this post. If your approach to sales is “always be closing,” keep reading. If you think there are only certain times you should reach out for a meeting or times to avoid when asking for a meeting, keep reading. If you believe allocators are flooded with emails and don’t want to hear from you, I beg you, keep reading. At Dakota, we’ve been very cautious in avoiding these three sales myths. We are an outsourced investment company raising money for other investment firms. Since our founding in 2006, we’ve raised over $35 billion for our clients, and add to this everyday by focusing on growing our total addressable market (TAM). In this article, we will break down the three most common sales myths and why you need to avoid them. At the end of this article, you will have a better understanding of how to counteract these myths and the proper ways to go about sales. Myth #1: ABC, or always be closing One of the most popular myths in the world is sales is that you should always be closing. Most people believe that you should never take no for an answer; however, I’m here to tell you that you should take no for an answer. Don’t get caught up in the convincing business, it’s a waste of time. This goes back to the simple golden rule of sales: spend time on the accounts who buy what you sell. Reality: Always be prospecting You can’t always be closing, but you can always be prospecting. In business, you should always be searching for people who buy what you sell. Align your investment strategy with people who invest in that structure. We have built our company off the belief that your TAM drives your company’s growth. For example, if you only have a separate account this would align with consultants, foundations, and endowments. Myth #2: There are only certain times to reach out for a meeting Some people don’t like to reach out for meetings under certain circumstances. This can be anything from the market being down, on a Friday, before a holiday, etc, but this is not the case. Reality: There are no bad times to reach out The truth is, there is no perfect time to reach out for a meeting. You should always be reaching out to people, emailing, and requesting meetings. In order to generate revenue you must get meetings, and it’s impossible to get meetings if you aren’t asking for them. A piece of advice I will give is to make sure you are reaching out in a respectful manner. If you send a succinct and to the point email, the recipient will be able to quickly decide whether it’s worth meeting you or not. Within your email, straightforward, simple subject line and deliver the highlights of your strategy in one sentence. Make sure your call to action is clear and direct with a specific time to meet, “Can you meet on August 4th at 3pm?”. This will result in the recipient realizing one of two things: they can meet and will set up a meeting with you, or they are unavailable at that time and will respond with an alternative to meet. Myth #3: Allocators are inundated with emails and calls and don’t want to hear from you This myth is semi true. It’s fair to say that allocators get a lot of emails, but there is no such thing as too many. This is why it is so important to be clear and to the point with your emails. Reality: Allocators want to hear from you The part people forget or fail to realize is that allocators do want to hear from you. As a salesperson, you bring them new product ideas and keep their wheels turning. In fact, did you know that allocators generate most of their good ideas by hearing from sales people? This is especially true of RIAs. You should be reaching out, despite the number of emails they may get. The more meetings you get with qualified buyers is all dependent on how many meetings you ask for. If you don’t get meetings, you either have a bad product, or a bad email. How to Get Started Now that we’ve covered the three common myths about sales, reflect and ask yourself if you’ve been guilty of any of these in the past. Remember, the key is to always be prospecting. With a larger group of people who buy what you sell, you have more opportunities to win. If you and your sales team are struggling with revenue, go back to the basics and look at who you’re trying to sell to. Always ask for the meeting - in a respectful, to the point way.  If you aren’t asking for meetings, you won’t be setting meetings up, and you won’t be making money.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': '3 of the Most Common Sales Myths Debunked', 'content': 'Another day goes by with minimal meetings set up for the future.

# article_364_the-one-golden-rule-of-sales

{'title': 'The One Golden Rule of Sales', 'introduction': "Sales has a million different components that lead to success. These can be anything from handling objections, product knowledge, active listening, among others. More than that, your strategy and approach will differ from client to client. The sales team at Dakota believes that there’s one golden rule to sales that every salesperson needs to gain an understanding of and include in their sales process. At Dakota, investment firms hire us to raise money for their mutual funds and separate accounts. Since 2006 we have raised over $35 billion for our clients. We owe our successes to a simple, 3-step process known as The Dakota Way. In this post we will give light to the golden rule of sales, then transition into The Dakota Way. After concluding your reading you’ll have an understanding of the golden rule and clarity on how to tie in The Dakota Way to your sales process. What is the golden rule of sales? The golden rule of sales is: pitch to people who buy what you sell. After all, why would you try to sell someone something they have no interest in, or any use for? The simple answer? You wouldn’t! Doing so would be a waste of your team’s time and resources, with very little pay off. At Dakota, our motto is: “Sell apples to apple buyers.” This means that you should focus on the audience that buys your product, rather than wasting time trying to convince them of a need they do not have. So, sell apples to apply buyers, don’t try to convince an orange buyer they might want an orange instead. Now that we’ve covered what the one golden rule of sales is, we’ll cover two key ways you and your sales team can apply it for success. How to apply the golden rule of sales 1. Stay Disciplined Most people fall off the wagon because they’re not rigorous enough on themselves; they don’t have enough precision around determining who their ideal buyer is. They go a mile wide and an inch deep. How is this going to benefit them? The correct answer is that it isn’t. Focus on growing your list of prospects and leads, and working it until it’s the single source of truth for your sales team. This is also known as finding and growing your Total Addressable Market (TAM). We have an entire article dedicated to finding out just how to do this. 2. Call on the right people Another common reason people fail to sell successfully is because they enjoy calling on big brand names and big firms. While this might feel good from an ego standpoint, it won’t work out in the end if those big brands don’t need the product you’re selling. Instead, the key is to stay hyper focused on people who do buy what you sell. You can call on one huge brand and spend hours preparing for the meeting, only to come up empty in the end. However, that same time can be spent preparing for meetings with several smaller brands who have a need and want to hear what you have to say. If you can be incredibly disciplined in finding the right fit buyer, the true customer, and focus your energy on them and building that group and only calling on that group, you’ll find success. At Dakota, we’ve applied these principles for over fifteen years, and have found it to be a successful, replicable method to sales. In this next section, we’ll explore what the Dakota Way is, how it relates to the golden rule, and how you can use it to take your sales process to the next level. What is The Dakota Way? The Dakota Way is a sales methodology that has helped the Dakota sales team raise $35B since 2006. It’s made up of three components: know who to call on, know what to say, and have a killer follow-up system. Separately, these things may seem simple, but when combined, they can create a powerful sales process that will lead your team to success. Below, we'll explain each piece of The Dakota Way and how you can apply it. 1. Know Who to Call On Like we mentioned above, the primary focus of your sales effort should be to people who buy what you sell. If you specialize in mutual funds, you need to call on allocators who deal in mutual funds: RIAs, ETFs, and separate accounts. Keep in mind that identifying the appropriate channels and contacts within each account can take a lot of time and legwork before you ask for a meeting. 2. Know What to Say Sadly this step is overlooked, but it’s so critical. Simply getting a meeting with the right person is not enough. To win business, you need to master the art of the pitch. Institutional investors need to understand your story and how you got to the numbers. You’ll have to use carefully chosen words to bring your story to life while addressing the questions an institutional investor wants answered. Talking performance won’t be enough. 3. Have a Killer Follow-Up System After getting the meeting and nailing the pitch, it’s critical that you follow up. Typically, most investment salespeople send a thank-you email with some marketing materials. But institutional investors get so many emails, they may never see it, let alone read it or respond. If your follow-up begins and ends with a single generic email, you’re losing sales. You need a follow-up system that helps you continue the conversation with allocators in a meaningful way. Find Who You’re Supposed to Call On Now that we’ve covered the golden rule of sales and The Dakota Way strategy, go put it into practice! It seems simple enough, but far too often people breeze over these steps. By hyper focusing on who to call on, knowing what to say, and having a killer follow up system you and your sales team will begin to see improvements with sales. It’s worked for us for 15 years, and we stand by it.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'The One Golden Rule of Sales', 'content': "Sales has a million different components that lead to success.

Focus on growing your list of prospects and leads, and working it until it’s the single source of truth for your sales team. This is also known as finding and growing your Total Addressable Market (TAM). We have an entire article dedicated to finding out just how to do this. 2. Call on the right people Another common reason people fail to sell successfully is because they enjoy calling on big brand names and big firms. While this might feel good from an ego standpoint, it won’t work out in the end if those big brands don’t need the product you’re selling. Instead, the key is to stay hyper focused on people who do buy what you sell. You can call on one huge brand and spend hours preparing for the meeting, only to come up empty in the end. However, that same time can be spent preparing for meetings with several smaller brands who have a need and want to hear what you have to say. If you can be incredibly disciplined in finding the right fit buyer, the true customer, and focus your energy on them and building that group and only calling on that group, you’ll find success. At Dakota, we’ve applied these principles for over fifteen years, and have found it to be a successful, replicable method to sales. In this next section, we’ll explore what the Dakota Way is, how it relates to the golden rule, and how you can use it to take your sales process to the next level. What is The Dakota Way? The Dakota Way is a sales methodology that has helped the Dakota sales team raise $35B since 2006. It’s made up of three components: know who to call on, know what to say, and have a killer follow-up system. Separately, these things may seem simple, but when combined, they can create a powerful sales process that will lead your team to success. Below, we'll explain each piece of The Dakota Way and how you can apply it. 1. Know Who to Call On Like we mentioned above, the primary focus of your sales effort should be to people who buy what you sell. If you specialize in mutual funds, you need to call on allocators who deal in mutual funds: RIAs, ETFs, and separate accounts. Keep in mind that identifying the appropriate channels and contacts within each account can take a lot of time and legwork before you ask for a meeting. 2. Know What to Say Sadly this step is overlooked, but it’s so critical. Simply getting a meeting with the right person is not enough. To win business, you need to master the art of the pitch. Institutional investors need to understand your story and how you got to the numbers. You’ll have to use carefully chosen words to bring your story to life while addressing the questions an institutional investor wants answered. Talking performance won’t be enough. 3. Have a Killer Follow-Up System After getting the meeting and nailing the pitch, it’s critical that you follow up. Typically, most investment salespeople send a thank-you email with some marketing materials. But institutional investors get so many emails, they may never see it, let alone read it or respond. If your follow-up begins and ends with a single generic email, you’re losing sales. You need a follow-up system that helps you continue the conversation with allocators in a meaningful way. Find Who You’re Supposed to Call On Now that we’ve covered the golden rule of sales and The Dakota Way strategy, go put it into practice! It seems simple enough, but far too often people breeze over these steps. By hyper focusing on who to call on, knowing what to say, and having a killer follow up system you and your sales team will begin to see improvements with sales. It’s worked for us for 15 years, and we stand by it.", 'bullet_points': [], 'subsections': []}], 'key_takeaways': [], 'faqs': []}

# article_327_10-surprising-crm-adoption-stats-and-how-to-avoid

{'title': '10 Surprising CRM Adoption Stats (and how to avoid becoming one of them)', 'introduction': 'As a salesperson, you’re probably already rolling your eyes at the title of this article. You’re tired of hearing about how important it is to enter data and meeting notes into your CRM. As a team of salespeople ourselves — we get it. But we’re here to shed some light on just how important it can be in the grand scheme of your organization. In fact, at Dakota, where we’ve raised over $40 billion since 2006, it’s one of the most tried and true aspects of our success. Without a CRM, we would never know when to follow up with a prospect, what kind of meetings the sales team is holding, and we’d never know how we were progressing against our pipeline. In short, having a CRM is critical, and we’re here to agree with everyone who has already told you as much. In this article, we’re going to highlight some shocking statistics about CRM adoption, and what you can do to avoid becoming one of them. In the end, true CRM adoption will change the way you do business, and by the end of this article, you’ll know the steps you can take to improve your team’s path to CRM adoption. 1. Manual data entry is the #1 reason why CRM adoption fails (source) It’s cumbersome to log into Salesforce and enter meeting details right after you’ve scheduled a meeting with a client or prospect. Expecting a team of sales professionals to do double data entry for every meeting can feel unrealistic. To avoid falling into the data entry trap, focus on automating your data entry so that it only has to be done once rather than multiple times across multiple platforms. We’ve talked before about integrations that do exactly this that you can read about here and here. 2. Introducing a data automation software to your CRM can eliminate up to 5.5 hours per week of manual entry for each sales person (source) Think about how much more time your sales team would have if they weren’t spending all of their time manually entering information into a CRM. They could be setting more meetings, doing more follow-up with qualified buyers, and furthering the company’s goals. While this may feel like a chicken and the egg scenario, the first step is to use the existing Salesforce data to start creating pipeline reports, then executing against them. Once the team sees the value in that data, in combination with a data automation software, they will be more inclined to continue inputting those meeting notes and details. 3. 32% of sales people spend over an hour on data entry every day (source) This goes hand in hand with our next statistic. Which is: 4. 65% of an average salesperson’s time is spent doing things apart from selling (source) Of course, when we say we think everyone should use a CRM, we don’t mean that they should spend all of their time keeping it updated and error-free. We definitely aren’t saying that it should be taking up 65% of your time. An all-in-one solution could mean the difference between wasting hours on data-entry and wasting time and effort doing meetings that never end up getting logged into a CRM and therefore forgotten. 5. Less than 37% of sales people actually use their company’s CRM system You might be wondering what causes this. What could make salespeople prefer a trip to the dentist over entering meeting notes. At Dakota, we\'ve found that this comes from a lack of structure within the CRM, and a lack of clean data. We have some tips on how to combat both of these that you can read here. In short, it boils down to effective training, embracing technology, and managing data effectively. 6. Under 40% of organizations have a CRM adoption rate over 90% (source) A troubling number, yes, but one that comes down to one thing: many people don\'t know how to define what CRM adoption looks like for their firm, let alone how to measure it. There are measurable goals you can put into place that include usage, data quality, and business performance metrics. You can find out more about each of them here. 7. 91% of data in CRM systems is predicted to be incomplete, stale, or duplicated each year (source) This can be an especially tricky one in an industry where up to 65% of people\'s job titles or functions change every year. We all hate to call on the wrong person when it can be avoided, but there is an even greater cost to incomplete and inaccurate data. Luckily, it\'s one that can be avoided. 8. Sales teams spend around 18% of their time in their CRM (source) The goal here is to make the most of the time they do spend within their CRM, which should be reviewing sales reports, reviewing their pipelines, and creating a follow-up plan, rather than entering data. 9. 22% of salespeople do not know what a CRM is (source) Chances are, if you\'re reading this, you already know what a CRM in. But in the event that you\'re still not quite sure what it is and how it applies to you, Salesforce defines a CRM as: "A technology for managing all your company’s relationships and interactions with customers and potential customers. The goal is simple: Improve business relationships to grow your business. A CRM system helps companies stay connected to customers, streamline processes, and improve profitability." 10. Implementing a CRM software can improve sales by up to 29% (source) Once you have your CRM successfully implemented, you\'re likely to see big results from the processes and procedures you put in place. This has been true for Dakota over the last fifteen years, to the point that we\'ve become evangelical about CRM usage.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': '10 Surprising CRM Adoption Stats (and how to avoid becoming one of them)', 'content': 'As a salesperson, you’re probably already rolling your eyes at the title of this article.

# article_267_q3-2022-etf-sub-asset-class-flow-trends

{'title': 'Q3 2022 ETF Sub-Asset Class Flow Trends', 'introduction': 'Our last 13F update we highlighted trends in alternative strategies in the ETF space as allocators have been seeking ways to lower their correlation to equities and fixed income through 2022 and Q3 accelerated this trend as the average equity and fixed income fund suffered a -5.89% and -2.42% loss, respectively. While traditional asset class have been performance challenged, allocators continue to look ahead and have been right sizing their exposure across both equity and bond ETFs all through 2022 which the 13F flow data reinforces these observations: CHART 1: The one trend that has been consistent all through 2022, and continued this quarter, was the shift from actively managed strategies to passive as we saw net $181 B leave active funds and shift a net $89 B into passive strategies.  Taking the market impact into account, the total net assets tracked via 13Fs during the quarter for ETFs dropped approximately -4% from $6.1 trillion at the end of Q2 to $5.91.  However, this is an improvement over the Q1 to Q2 drop we saw of -12% in net assets. From an asset class perspective, equity ETFs continue to hold the bulk of assets at 75% of assets, with fixed income ETFs continuing to grow and are at 20% of assets.

{'title': 'July 2024 Financial Advisor and RIA Moves and Acquisitions', 'introduction': 'In July, Dakota followed notable mergers and acquisitions including KKR\'s acquisition of Janney Montgomery Scott and Sequoia Financial Group\'s purchase of Karpas Strategies, contributing to a continued trend of consolidation within the investment management sector. LPL Financial, UBS, and Raymond James have actively recruited numerous financial advisor teams, including high-profile advisors from firms like Morgan Stanley, Edward Jones, and Merrill Lynch, as these advisors seek to enhance their service offerings and independence. Wealth Enhancement Group, Robertson Stephens Wealth Management, and EP Wealth have significantly expanded their presence through strategic acquisitions, with Wealth Enhancement Group alone making multiple acquisitions across various states. Rockefeller Capital Management and Focus Financial Partners have also bolstered their positions by onboarding established advisory teams and merging partner firms, respectively. Overall, the independent wealth management landscape is seeing substantial growth as firms strengthen their capabilities and reach. One of the larger acquisitions this month, KKR, a leading global investment firm, and The Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company announced on July 23, 2024, a definitive agreement for KKR to acquire Janney Montgomery Scott LLC through its investment funds. Founded in 1832, Janney is a prominent wealth management, investment banking, and asset management firm with over $150 billion in assets under administration. The firm has more than 900 financial advisors offering financial planning, asset allocation, and retirement planning services across 135 U.S. offices. Post-transaction, Janney will become a standalone private company, continuing to operate independently. KKR plans to implement a broad-based equity ownership program for Janney\'s 2,300 employees, promoting team member engagement through ownership. This approach aligns with KKR\'s strategy of enhancing company strength through employee ownership, which has been applied to over 50 KKR portfolio companies since 2011. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, pending customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.  KKR\'s investment in Janney will be primarily through its North America Fund XIII. The acquisition aims to leverage Janney\'s established market position and KKR\'s investment expertise to drive growth and innovation.

# article_221_top-10-ria-firms-in-the-philadelphia-metro-area

{'title': 'Top 10 RIA Firms in the Philadelphia Metro Area', 'introduction': 'The RIA Channel is one of the most dynamic and fast growing channels for investment firms to sell their investment strategies to. The challenge has always been: “what RIAs invest in outside managers and are not investment managers themselves?” Through our Dakota Marketplace RIA database, we have aimed to solve that problem by curating and vetting each RIA by hand and only showing those RIAs that are true prospects for an investment firm. This saves both the investment sales team member time, but also saves the “other” RIAs that don’t allocate to other managers from getting unnecessary emails and phone calls. Below are a few RIAs in Philadelphia that we thought you might like to know. For a more detailed list of RIAs in Philadelphia, click here to see for free. 1.

# article_016_new-rias-and-investment-firms-from-may-2025-ria-la

{'title': 'New RIAs and Investment Firms from May 2025 | RIA Launches', 'introduction': 'We are pleased to present the Monthly Report of Newly Formed RIAs - May 2025. We are continuously blown away by the large number of newly created RIAs from the SEC report with a total of 220. As part of our monthly process, our data team reviewed and scrubbed this month’s raw file of 220 new filings, identifying 85 new wealth manager RIAs and 57 new investment firm RIAs. We then researched the appropriate contacts and related information before uploading everything to Dakota Marketplace. May 2025 marked a sharp uplift in SEC registrations: 85 new RIAs and 57 new investment firms formed, more than doubling April’s combined tally (54 RIAs, 12 investment firms). RIAs grew 57% month-over-month, while investment firms surged 4x, signalling heightened appetite for pooled-capital vehicles. Scale improved at the top end. Five firms launched with assets above $1 billion in May (up from one in April), nudging large-cap entrants to ~3 % of all new registrants. The remaining 137 entities still fell below the $500 million threshold, so small-cap volume continues to dominate in absolute terms. Geographically, New York City remained the busiest market, but Dallas displaced Los Angeles as the second-most active metro—highlighting a fresh growth corridor in Texas alongside the enduring strength of the US financial hub.

# article_078_family-offices-and-their-increased-appetite-for-al

{'title': 'Family Offices and Their Increased Appetite for Alternatives', 'introduction': 'As family offices grow in both size and sophistication, they are evolving into more complex and discerning investors. Historically, family offices focused on preserving wealth through traditional investments such as public equities and bonds. However, as these entities have expanded, their investment strategies have matured, leading to a marked shift toward alternative investments. With increasingly diverse portfolios, family offices are capitalizing on private equity, real estate, venture capital, and other alternatives to enhance returns, reduce risk, and hedge against inflation. In this article, we\'ll go over the growing trend of family offices shifting toward alternative investments such as private equity, real estate, and venture capital. By the end of this article, you\'ll have a better understanding of why these alternatives are gaining popularity and how family offices are navigating the associated challenges. The Shift Toward Alternative Investments According to a survey conducted by KKR, family office allocations to alternatives are increasing. The CIO’s of 75 family offices surveyed expect their alternatives exposure to grow from 42% to 52% from 2022 through 2024. On the other hand, equities exposure is expected to decrease from 32% to 29% (Institutional Investor). Outperformance The move to alternatives reflects several factors, most notably the pursuit of higher returns. Public equity markets have become more volatile, and traditional asset classes like bonds have seen declining yields due to prolonged periods of low interest rates. By contrast, alternative assets like private equity and real estate have consistently outperformed over long periods. For example, despite strong returns from the public markets recently, private equity has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past 5, 10, 15 and 20 year periods. The Pitchbook North American Private Equity Index returned 18.8% over the past 5 years, while the S&P 500 only returned 9.9% (FS Investments). Illiquidity premium Family offices, with their long-term investment horizons and sizable capital, are particularly well-suited to take advantage of the illiquidity offered by alternatives. Family offices may view the illiquidity of these investments as a potential benefit, allowing them to capture the "illiquidity premium" — the extra return expected from holding assets that cannot be easily sold. Unlike institutional investors, they are not constrained by short-term performance metrics, allowing them to invest in private markets, which often require locking up capital for extended periods. Diversification & Inflation Protection Diversification through alternatives allows family offices to reduce their exposure to traditional asset classes, such as stocks and bonds, which are highly correlated with broader market movements. Alternatives, by contrast, often have low correlations with public markets, enabling family offices to build more resilient portfolios that can withstand market volatility. Additionally, many alternatives are considered effective hedges against inflation. Real estate, infrastructure, and commodities often perform well in inflationary environments because their values tend to rise with increasing prices. Real estate, in particular, benefits from inflation as property values and rental income typically grow in step with inflation. Challenges in Alternative Investments Despite the clear benefits, alternative investments come with challenges. Illiquidity: Even though it was mentioned earlier that illiquid assets tend to be a non-issue for family offices, they can still pose risks. Despite the long-term investment horizons of family offices, the illiquidity of private investments can still pose an issue, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty when accessing capital becomes crucial. Fees: The higher management fees and performance fees (carried interest) associated with private equity and hedge funds can eat into returns if not carefully managed. Minimums: Many alternative funds require high minimum investments, sometimes in the range of $1 million to $10 million or more. This can limit smaller family offices or those looking for greater diversification across asset classes or managers. To navigate these challenges, many family offices are building in-house expertise or relying on specialized advisors to perform due diligence, assess risks, and manage the complex financial structures that come with alternative assets. This topic will be discussed in the following blog post. Dakota Marketplace for Family Offices Dakota Marketplace empowers investment firms to forge direct connections with family offices, strengthening their sales and relationship-building efforts.

# article_064_should-family-offices-bring-investment-expertise-i

{'title': "Should Family Offices Bring Investment Expertise In-House? Here's What You Need to Know", 'introduction': "Family offices are increasingly transforming into highly sophisticated investment entities, with many now hiring in-house experts to manage their growing portfolios of alternative assets. This shift is part of a broader trend where family offices are looking to reduce their dependence on external managers and take more control over their investment strategies. In doing so, they aim to optimize costs, improve decision-making processes, and align their investments with the family's long-term vision and values. Mentioned in the previous blog post, family office allocations to alternatives are increasing. KKR’s survey concluded that the CIO’s of 75 family offices surveyed expect their alternatives exposure to grow from 42% to 52% from 2022 through 2024. This increase in alternatives warrants more investment expertise. In this article, we’ll be covering how family offices are evolving by bringing investment expertise in-house, examining the key benefits, challenges, and strategic advantages of this shift. By the end, you’ll have a better understanding of why many family offices are making this transition and how it could impact their long-term success. Hiring In-House Investment Staff By bringing on board investment specialists from sectors like private equity, venture capital, and real estate, family offices are enhancing their ability to evaluate deals, perform due diligence, and manage risk. In fact, according to research from Institutional Investor, 73% of family offices that have preserved wealth for three generations or more now employ chief investment officers (CIOs), compared to 57% for first- or second-generation family offices \u200b(Institutional Investor). In-house investment teams enable family offices to customize their investment approaches and make quicker, more agile decisions. These professionals are often tasked with managing both traditional and alternative assets, with a particular focus on private equity and real estate investments. Family offices must look for candidates that possess strong financial analysis skills, including expertise in valuation methods (DCF, comparables), financial modeling, and capital structures. They must excel in conducting thorough due diligence on financial, operational, and legal risks, as well as analyzing market trends. Additionally, they should be adept at structuring and negotiating deals. These professionals often come from backgrounds in investment banking, private equity, venture capital, or management consulting, with many holding advanced degrees like MBAs or CFA certifications. However, hiring an in-house investment staff is very expensive, especially for family offices with AUM below $500 million. According to a report from Citi Private Bank (Citi), around 39% of family offices with AUM below $500 million reported not having a CIO, compared to only 22% for those with higher AUM. This discrepancy is logical, as hiring and retaining a full-time CIO represents a substantial financial commitment that smaller offices may not be able to justify. As a result, family offices with less than $500 million in AUM are 50% more likely to use an outsourced CIO (12% versus 8%)\u200b. The Role of Alternative Investment Expertise Family offices are increasingly focusing on alternatives because of their potential for high returns and diversification benefits. However, these investments are also more complex and require specialized knowledge. In-house experts provide family offices with the necessary expertise to evaluate deals, understand market trends, and navigate illiquidity issues associated with private markets. Having an in-house investment team helps family offices invest more effectively in private equity funds for several reasons: Due Diligence: Internal teams provide deep expertise to thoroughly assess private equity funds, ensuring alignment with the family’s goals and risk tolerance. Cost Efficiency: By managing fund investments directly, family offices can reduce fees typically paid to external consultants or advisors. Customized Strategy: In-house teams can tailor private equity fund selection to match the family’s long-term vision, focus on specific sectors, and optimize portfolio diversification. Faster Decision-Making: Internal experts enable quicker and more informed investment decisions, giving the family office a competitive edge In addition to investing in private equity and venture capital funds, family offices are increasingly participating in direct deals and co-investments. This has become a significant trend, as co-investments allow family offices to invest alongside private equity firms in individual deals, often without having to pay the typical management fees associated with private equity funds. This not only reduces costs but also provides family offices with greater transparency and influence over the investment. These types of transactions can also result in higher potential returns relative to traditional fund investments. According to a report from BNY Wealth Management, 62% of family offices made 6 or more direct investments last year, and 71% are planning to make a similar number or more over the coming year (BNY). The ability to invest directly or co-invest alongside private equity firms also allows family offices to diversify their portfolios while maintaining control over specific deals. This approach provides family offices with the flexibility to invest in sectors or geographies where they have expertise or a particular interest. Best Practices for Family Offices To fully leverage the benefits of hiring in-house experts, family offices should implement several best practices. A Partners Capital white paper highlighted the following recommendations for success: Strong Governance: Establish a clear investment committee to oversee decisions and ensure alignment with family goals. Diversification: Spread investments across geographies and asset classes to reduce risk, especially in illiquid alternatives. Direct Investing: Leverage direct deals and co-investments through thorough due diligence and partnerships. Risk Management: Implement a risk framework aligned with liquidity needs and family risk tolerance. Education and Adaptability: Continuously educate the team and adapt strategies to evolving markets. Strengthen Investment Strategies with In-House Knowledge Family offices are becoming increasingly sophisticated in their approach to alternative investments by hiring in-house experts to manage complex portfolios. This shift allows them to conduct more thorough due diligence, participate in direct deals, and align investment strategies with the family’s long-term goals. While hiring in-house talent can be costly, the benefits of greater control, cost efficiency, and more personalized investment strategies make it a worthwhile investment for many family offices.

# article_286_financial-advisor-and-ria-acquisitions-reported-in

{'title': 'Financial Advisor and RIA Acquisitions Reported in September 2022', 'introduction': 'With back to school and fall sports in full swing, teams, advisers and RIA‘s were just as busy with their activity. During this period we did not see as many purchases of RIA‘s as that cooled at bit from the record pace we have been seeing for the past few months. LPL has risen slightly above Rockefeller in terms of new recruits year to date. Attrition continues from Merrill, Wells, MS, and UBS as some FAs are valuing work from anywhere flexibility over a physical office.  That said, the wires have been “very competitive “ lately offering recruiting deals of over 300% trailing 12 month production. Given that the many FAs are feed based today, the fact that assets began to drop in 2022 and recruiting is based on trailing fees, this has been a factor in the moves this year. Below are the FA and RIA acquisitions reported throughout the first two weeks of September of 2022. UBS UBS has been one of the more active recruiters coming into September and have been offering recruiting packages with less back-end commitments. Carl V.

# article_085_dakota-fund-tracker-week-of-9-16-2024

{'title': 'Dakota Fund Tracker | Week of 9-16-2024', 'introduction': 'The "New Funds Tracker" blog is your weekly roundup of newly launched funds in the market, based on Form D filings. This blog delivers critical insights into the latest trends within the investment landscape, offering a comprehensive overview of where capital is flowing and which sectors are gaining momentum. This week, several new funds have been launched, reflecting a wide range of asset classes and strategies. Below, we’ll discuss the trends across asset classes, industries, and geographic focus. In this article, we’ll give you a breakdown overview of these new funds, and a highlight into trends across asset classes and the industry. Asset class trends: Private Equity: Private equity remains the dominant player in fundraising activity. This week\'s filings show a variety of strategies, including co-investments, which allow investors to participate in targeted deals. Notable sectors being focused on within these funds include technology, consumer goods, healthcare, and industrial sectors. One key fund filing is the Investcorp Employee Co-Investment Program, which is targeting a diverse range of industries from consumer to technology. This reflects a broad interest in sectors that provide a balance between resilience and growth potential, particularly in a rapidly evolving economic environment. Venture Capital: Venture capital is experiencing a strong uptick this week, with 11 new funds launched, indicating significant interest in early-stage, high-growth sectors. These funds are predominantly focused on technology-driven sectors such as FinTech, artificial intelligence, and digital infrastructure. As startups continue to disrupt traditional industries, venture capital is proving to be a key player in backing innovative companies with scalable business models. For example, several funds are targeting opportunities in the FinTech space, reflecting ongoing demand for technologies that streamline financial services and introduce new efficiencies. Additionally, there’s growing interest in sectors like healthcare technology and AI, with funds looking to capitalize on the rapid advancements in these fields. This week’s venture capital activity underscores the appetite for disruptive technologies and the potential for high returns in these emerging markets. Private Credit: Private credit continues to be a significant focus for investors, particularly funds targeting senior secured loans and structured lending. This week’s filings show that private credit funds are positioning themselves to capitalize on opportunities in middle-market lending, especially in a rising interest rate environment where traditional financing has become more constrained. For example, FS Senior Credit Fund II, L.P. is one such fund designed to provide capital to companies in need of flexible financing solutions, particularly in the mid-market space. With secure loan structures at the core of this strategy, the private credit space continues to offer compelling opportunities for investors seeking yield while managing risk. Private Infrastructure: There’s also ongoing interest in Private Infrastructure, with a noticeable focus on sustainable and agricultural projects. The launch of Brookfield l Oaktree’s Catalytic Transition Fund highlights the growing attention to sectors such as agriculture, which play into global sustainability and food security trends. Infrastructure continues to be an area of interest, particularly for investors looking to align their portfolios with long-term, global challenges. Industry trends: Technology & FinTech: Technology remains a leading sector for investment, particularly in areas such as FinTech, SaaS, and digital infrastructure. As the digital transformation accelerates, funds are actively seeking opportunities in emerging technologies that promise scalability and disruption. This week’s filings show continued interest in companies innovating in the FinTech and software spaces. The Investcorp Co-Investment Program also targets sectors like consumer and technology, suggesting that established funds are increasingly looking to invest in companies driving the future of business with digital-first solutions. SaaS is particularly gaining traction, with firms seeking scalable solutions that provide recurring revenue and high-growth potential. Agriculture & Consumer Goods: This week, agriculture has emerged as a focal point for private infrastructure funds, particularly those looking to invest in sustainable and essential sectors. As sustainability continues to shape global investment strategies, funds such as the Catalytic Transition Fund are setting their sights on industries that are integral to long-term environmental and economic sustainability. On the consumer side, FS Investments is an example of a firm aligning its credit strategy with broader consumer trends. Consumer-facing sectors continue to attract investor interest, particularly in areas related to financial services and industrial products that respond to evolving market demands. Geographic distribution: Geographically, this week’s new funds continue to demonstrate a global reach, with North America remaining a primary focus. However, there is growing interest in diversifying investments globally, with several funds indicating exposure to Europe, Asia, and other emerging markets. Global exposure is key for funds like Hamilton Lane Impact Fund III-A LP, which is not only targeting equity investments but also seeking opportunities across a broad array of sectors worldwide, with a focus on regions like Africa, Australia, and South America. This geographic diversification is aimed at capturing growth in both developed and emerging markets while mitigating risks tied to any one region. Summary This week\'s new fund filings offer a clear picture of ongoing trends across asset classes and industries. Private equity and private credit remain dominant, with a strong emphasis on sectors such as technology, consumer goods, and infrastructure. In addition, firms continue to expand their geographic horizons, seeking global diversification in an increasingly interconnected market. The combination of broad sector interest – spanning technology and agriculture – with the geographic expansion into global markets, highlights the evolving strategies investment managers are adopting to navigate the current economic landscape. As we continue to track these trends, it is evident that the market remains dynamic, with investors positioning themselves for growth across resilient and high-potential industries.

# article_200_the-one-foolproof-way-for-investment-firms-to-get

{'title': 'The One Foolproof Way for Investment Firms to Get Their Salesforce Configured, Implemented, and Used - Marketplace for Salesforce is the Solution', 'introduction': 'The Dakota Marketplace for Salesforce App is a revolutionary app built for investment firms and their fundraising teams. We can take the liberty to say that 100% of investment firms who use Salesforce.com struggle with the configuration of their Salesforce instance to suit the specific needs of their fundraisers and salespeople. In addition to the struggle with configuration, investment firms struggle with keeping their data up-to-date. On top of keeping their data up-to-date, they struggle with bringing in important data feeds directly into their Salesforce instance, like 13F, Form ADV and Form D. The result? No CRM adoption, frustration with the sales team, and lack of critical data getting entered into Salesforce, such as meetings and meeting notes. This ultimately translates into a massive lack of leverage and sales efficiency for the investment firm and their salespeople. The reason for this is extremely simple: Custom Salesforce Developers lack the domain expertise in the investment management industry to properly set-up and configure a Salesforce instance for fundraising teams. The cost is high both in terms of opportunity cost and actual cash spent and/or wasted in trying to get an instance set-up. In this article we will break down problems with implementing a CRM, how you solve this problem, and lastly the Dakota Marketplace for Salesforce App. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of the Marketplace for Salesforce App and how it acts as the solution to getting your Salesforce configured and implemented. The problem Many issues arise from failed CRM implementations, thus leading to an unsuccessful adoption. This can be from the following list of reasons: Initial custom development Ongoing custom programing Configuration of new data feeds Lack of domain expertise Database administration Data updating Data collection Email bounce software This is a long list of tasks that no salesperson wants to do, or has time to do.

# article_206_why-you-need-a-crm-to-succeed-in-investment-sales

{'title': 'Why You Need a CRM to Succeed in Investment Sales', 'introduction': "In the realm of investment management, the role of a CRM system cannot be overstated. Traditional CRM systems, while beneficial, often fall short in meeting the niche demands of the industry. This gap has led to myths surrounding CRM effectiveness and adoption. In reality CRMs do not fall short at all, rather, it is the failed implementation of CRM adoption. In this article we are reviewing the myths to CRMs and why they are vital for your organization and sales team. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of the benefits to adopting a CRM properly, and your solution to this common problem. Debunking CRM Myths CRM systems have often been critiqued for being generic and not catering to specific industry needs. In the investment sales sector, the primary need is for a system that meticulously tracks and manages client interactions. CRMs have a bad reputation for being useless, too difficult to use, or containing stale data. While some CRMs may in fact be universally the same and ineffectively generic, Dakota Marketplace for Salesforce is not. Our innovative solution is designed specifically for investment sales professionals who are out fundraising, ensuring that every feature is relevant, useful, and actually being implemented. We’ll get more into the Dakota Marketplace for Salesforce product later in this article. With that, let’s dive into the main benefits of a CRM for a company and their sales people. Benefits of a CRM: the company A CRM offers multifaceted benefits to a company, primarily in two key areas: capturing scheduled meetings and documentation of meeting notes, and secondly, fostering overall organizational success. The capability to systematically record scheduled meetings along with detailed notes is invaluable. It enables the company to effectively monitor and evaluate the productivity and engagement of its workforce. By capturing the essence of each meeting - who was present, the topics discussed, decisions made, and action items assigned - the organization gains a clear and accountable record of its business interactions. Benefits of a CRM: the sales person For sales professionals, a CRM system is a powerful tool that extends beyond mere record-keeping. It allows them to generate detailed reports on past activities and meetings, offering a comprehensive view of customer engagement and sales progress. This feature is particularly beneficial for identifying trends, understanding customer needs, and tailoring follow-up actions accordingly. The ability to access and analyze this data empowers salespeople to execute timely follow-ups. It ensures that no opportunity is missed and that every customer interaction is maximized for potential sales. The integration of these functionalities within a CRM system is not just a convenience; it is a critical component in driving sales efficiency, enhancing customer relationships, and ultimately contributing to the success and growth of both the individual salesperson and the organization as a whole. The problem with your CRM: custom configuration Up until this point in time, the cost of custom programming and fields is expensive and time consuming. You hire an outside developer to help build out your Salesforce, but they lack any form of industry knowledge specifically tailored to your firm. It’s like putting a cat in a swimming pool competing with fish. This ends in frustration, and ultimately leads to a failed CRM adoption. The solution to this is Dakota's Salesforce App. Our App takes 100% of the features, functionality, and data of Dakota Marketplace, and puts it directly inside of your Salesforce instance. Dakota’s Salesforce App brings all relevant information that an investment sales person needs to do their job while up keeping all contact data up to date in real time. The Dakota Salesforce App stands as a testament to how industry-specific CRM solutions can transform business processes. By addressing the unique needs of the investment sales professional, Dakota’s app not only debunks common CRM myths, but also sets a new standard for how CRM systems should cater to industry-specific requirements. Dakota’s Salesforce App is not just an option; it’s a necessity for any investment management firm aiming to excel in fundraising.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'Why You Need a CRM to Succeed in Investment Sales', 'content': "In the realm of investment management, the role of a CRM system cannot be overstated.
