{'title': 'Generational Differences Among Family Offices: Insights for Investment Managers', 'introduction': "Family offices play a vital role in managing the financial, operational, and personal priorities of ultra-high-net-worth families. Beyond wealth management, they are crucial in preserving family legacies, preparing future generations for leadership, and aligning entrepreneurial and philanthropic goals with a shared vision. However, not all family offices are alike. First- and second-generation family offices differ significantly in their investment priorities and approaches, shaped by their unique circumstances and objectives. For investment firms, understanding these distinctions is essential to building meaningful and enduring relationships with family office clients. In this article, we'll explore the distinct investment priorities and leadership approaches that differentiate first- and second-generation family offices. By the end, you'll have a clearer understanding of how these differences can guide investment managers in building lasting partnerships with family office clients. First-Generation Family Offices: Entrepreneurship, Concentration, and Growth In first-generation family offices, leadership often remains firmly in the hands of the founder, reflecting the entrepreneurial mindset that built the family's wealth through innovation, strategic vision, and calculated risk-taking. Founders are deeply involved in decision-making, with nearly 90% of family offices reporting active family participation, according to the J.P. Morgan 2024 Global Family Office Report. This entrepreneurial mindset is evident in their asset allocation and portfolio construction, which often centers on the wealth-generating assets that built their financial foundation, such as single-stock positions, operating businesses, or real estate. These core holdings typically represent a substantial share of the family’s net worth, providing both growth potential and liquidity. This financial stability enables first-generation families to think long-term and pursue higher-risk, less-liquid investments. Consequently, their portfolios show a strong preference for alternative investments, including private equity, venture capital, and direct investments in private companies. New call-to-action The Neuberger Berman Family Offices 2024: Adjusting to Post-Inflation Markets Whitepaper finds that first-generation families allocate over 55% of their portfolios to alternative investments, with buyouts (27%) and venture capital (11%)—both high-return, highly illiquid asset classes—comprising the largest allocations. Meanwhile, traditional public equities account for just 30%, with 18% invested in international and emerging markets equities and 9% in U.S. large-cap stocks. Fixed income makes up approximately 15% of their portfolios, reflecting a relatively smaller emphasis on conservative investments. Second-Generation Family Offices: Professionalization, Preservation, and Diversification As leadership transitions to the next generation, family offices often adjust their focus. Second-generation family offices emphasize professionalized management, wealth preservation, and sustainable growth, adopting a more collaborative and diversified investment approach. While second-generation families continue to prioritize alternative investments, their approach is more balanced and conservative than that of their predecessors, focusing on stability and predictable returns. According to Neuberger Berman, second-generation families allocate 51% of their portfolios to alternative assets, similar to first-generation families. However, private credit (17% versus 0%) and private real estate (4% versus 1%) play a much more prominent role, as these lower-risk, income-generating assets help offset reduced exposure to higher-risk investments like buyouts (10% versus 27%) and venture capital (4% versus 11%). Second-generation portfolios also dedicate 28% to traditional public equities, broadly diversified across U.S., international, and emerging markets. Notably, exposure to REITs is higher at 9% (compared to 2% for first-generation families), reflecting a balanced approach aimed at stability and diversification. Fixed income allocations average 21%, slightly higher than in first-generation portfolios, aligning with the overarching goals of wealth preservation and steady growth. New call-to-action Striking the right balance between growth and preservation remains a central priority for second-generation family offices, ensuring they honor the family’s legacy while adopting a sustainable approach to wealth management as assets transition between generations. Bridging the Generational Gap Generational differences significantly shape how family offices approach leadership, investment strategies, and long-term goals. First-generation family offices, driven by their founders' entrepreneurial spirit, prioritize high-growth investments such as buyouts, venture capital, and direct holdings. In contrast, second-generation offices emphasize diversification, professional management, and wealth preservation, aiming for sustainable growth across generations. For investment firms, understanding these generational distinctions is crucial. As family offices play an increasingly influential role in global markets and wealth transitions to the next generation, firms that bridge these generational gaps will be better positioned for long-term success.

{'title': 'Fundraising Strategies for Emerging Managers Calling on Consultants', 'introduction': 'Emerging managers often face the challenge of growing their businesses on limited budgets, and Dakota’s Emerging Manager Growth Show is designed specifically to help. Hosted by Dakota’s CEO and Founder, Gui Costin, the show offers practical advice on how managers can do more with less. Each episode focuses on different institutional channels such as RIAs, pension funds, family offices, banks and broker-dealers or consultants, and provides actionable tips on scaling, best practices, and navigating industry trends. The goal is to equip emerging managers with the tools needed to thrive in a competitive landscape. This past November, the Emerging Manager Growth Show focused on the Consultant Channel with Gui Costin and Tim Dolan sharing their insights on its significance for emerging managers. While emphasizing the long-term potential of the consultant channel, they discussed the importance of systematically targeting emerging manager consultants, large global consultants, and OCIO groups. They highlighted strategies for successful outreach, including the critical role of consistency, building tailored approaches for consultants, and integrating these efforts alongside primary focus areas like RIAs to maximize fundraising success. In this article, we will cover the key takeaways from November’s Emerging Manager Growth Show. By the end of this, you’ll have actionable tips to help you navigate the Consultant space and grow your business. Key Takeaways 1. Cold Outreach: The Foundation of Fundraising For emerging managers, cold outreach remains essential. Gui and Tim emphasize that while it’s tough, there’s no alternative to systematically reaching out to potential investors. Effective cold outreach involves: City scheduling: Plan meetings in key cities at least six weeks in advance. Clear email communication: Write concise, compelling emails with a specific call to action (e.g., “Can you meet on December 6 at 11 AM?”). Open-ended requests, like "Are you available in the next few weeks?" are far less effective. Volume with quality: 15-25 outreach emails per day focused on relevant accounts. 2. The Consultant Channel: An Essential Piece of the Puzzle Consultants are a must-hit channel for emerging managers, but their timelines are long, and allocations tend to be smaller. There are three main consultant types to target: Emerging Manager Consultants: Examples include Xponance, Attucks, Legato, and Stable. These consultants often allocate to early-stage managers but may negotiate fees heavily. Large National and Global Consultants: While these require longer-term relationship-building, they can provide significant opportunities. OCIO Groups (Outsourced Chief Investment Officers): This growing segment bridges the gap between consultants and direct allocations. Gui and Tim stress covering consultants systematically while maintaining a primary focus on RIAs (Registered Investment Advisors) for short-term success. New call-to-action 3. The Power of Quarterly Webinars Quarterly webinars are a high-leverage tool for brand building and investor engagement. These events allow managers to: Provide insights: Share performance updates, highlight standout investments, and discuss investment philosophy. Build trust: Position themselves as thought leaders and trusted partners. Streamline communication: Reduce the need for one-on-one calls by addressing common questions for multiple stakeholders. A webinar should be recorded, transcribed, and repurposed as a follow-up tool in emails and meetings. 4. Money Is In Motion Emerging managers like Spruce Capital, a real estate debt strategy, are achieving notable milestones. In this case, the firm’s oversubscribed first close reached half of its $750 million target. The key takeaway? Money is in motion, and consistent cold outreach, combined with unique investment ideas, can lead to significant breakthroughs. 5. Exclusive Interview with Screendoor The highlight of the episode was an insightful interview with Screendoor partners Lisa Cawley and Jamie Rhode. Screendoor’s unique approach focuses on: Backing diverse managers with unconventional backgrounds: They emphasize non-consensus qualities, such as unique career paths and personal journeys, which often lead to outsized returns. Leveraging GP advisors: Experienced General Partners provide strategic guidance to emerging managers, helping them navigate challenges and scale their firms effectively. Making the process accessible: Screendoor actively seeks out managers through LP networks, referrals, and an open online submission process. Emerging managers seeking seed capital and guidance should consider engaging with Screendoor, which plans to deploy $200–$250 million in the coming year. 6. Persistence is Key The episode concluded with Gui and Tim reiterating the importance of staying active in the market. Success in fundraising requires constant effort—booking meetings, leveraging tools like Dakota Marketplace, and executing strategies such as webinars and targeted outreach. As Gui put it, "The juice is worth the squeeze." Your Path to Consultant Channel Success Episode 25 of The Emerging Manager Growth Show offers a roadmap for emerging managers navigating the complex world of fundraising. Whether it’s leveraging consultants, mastering cold outreach, or building your brand through webinars, the strategies shared by Gui, Tim, and Screendoor provide actionable steps for growth.

# article_342_how-to-write-an-effective-investment-sales-email-t

{'title': 'How to Write an Effective Investment Sales Email That Gets the Meeting', 'introduction': 'Let’s start off with a little story about how crazy the investment business is as it\'s related to email. Here\'s the deal - if you raise money for a living, you know one thing is true as true can be: you can\'t raise money without a meeting. You have to be able to get a meeting with a qualified buyer and a pool of capital. We work for these super-smart people: portfolio managers, great investors, great education, you get the picture — in fact, you probably live it every day. The question is, with all the emails that everyone receives, what drives them to open an email? How do you get a meeting? How does it all work? The answer is the subject line. At the end of the day, if we\'re tied to meetings and super-smart people who manage great portfolios, essentially what makes or breaks getting a meeting with them is the subject line. Why is that? Subject lines are what catch someone\'s attention and decide whether or not they even see the rest of your message. Then, if the email\'s well-written and includes a strong call to action, it just might elicit a response. In this article, we\'re going outline how you can craft emails designed to get a meeting. We’ll walk through through the three section every email needs, and what you should include in each. By the end of the article, you’ll know exactly what to include in your emails to get your point across and, most importantly, get the meeting. Section 1: the subject line At the end of the day, all investment sales people care about at the end of the day is one thing: getting meetings with qualified buyers. When we go into a city to schedule meetings, it\'s this simple: you get a meeting with a strong subject line. You have to get to the point. Take this for example: Say you’ll be in New York City on October 5th, so you make your subject line “meeting request for October 5th at 3:00 PM.” Now the person reading the email knows exactly what that email holds for them. They know you want a meeting with them because it’s crystal clear in the subject line. Now, if you want to increase your response rate, put the word “video” in the subject line. This concept hasn\'t gotten out there yet in the investment world. If you have a video introducing yourself, definitely include this in the email. Section 2: the body The second thing to focus on is what we like to call the JP Morgan Private Bank test. This is where we will say the recipient’s name and say exactly what we want or what we’re looking for. This part needs to be one sentence that packs a punch and illustrates the value of your investment firm. At Dakota, we tell our team to make this sentence extremely simple, while knowing that one sentence has to do a lot of heavy lifting. You have to make it count. Take this sentence for example: “Hello, my name\'s Gui Costin. I\'m calling from JP Morgan Private Bank. Unfortunately, your 99-year-old great aunt just died and left you a million dollars. Please reply to this email with your wiring instructions.” If it\'s a legit email, you\'re going to obtain a 100% response rate. What we mean by this is that you want to make sure you\'re really getting to the point in the most acute way possible, while bringing your strategy to life in one sentence. Think through what you can say that will be so compelling that the reader looks at it and says, "You know what? This is a meeting I want to take when this person is in town on October 5th at 3:00 PM." Section 3: the call to action So, you\'ve written your one powerful sentence and successfully introduced your firm. Now it\'s time to close out the email. This is where we\'ve seen a lot of salespeople fall down. The closing needs to have a very clear call to action. A lot of people say, "Hey, can you meet sometime on October 5th?" Or, "Can you meet sometime next week?" Even, "Can you meet sometime next month?" What\'s the problem with these closing? They\'re not giving anyone specificity. This gives them the opportunity to say, "No, I can\'t meet," and end the conversation right there. The key is to pick a specific date and time, something to allow room for the person to say yes, or to suggest an alternate time, rather than giving a simple "no." Why is this so important? Because our lives and our careers unfortunately live and die by the quality of our emails. The quality of our subject lines, the quality of that one sentence, and the power in that clear call to action. Make your emails count, and watch your meeting count climb Too many people write emails by rote, not taking the time to personalize their messages, or ask for what they want. Or, even worse, they write extremely long paragraph-by-paragraph explanations of their firm that go unread because they\'re overwhelming; they\'re trying to get everything they can into that one email. Don\'t be that person. Instead, think of email writing as an art. Your art is to write that one sentence. Make it so meaningful about your investment strategy that someone thinks, "You know what? Based upon what you just said, it sounds too compelling not to take the meeting." Your emails exist to obtain one result, and that\'s to book the meeting. Nothing else. You don\'t need to get into how your firm was founded. You don\'t want to get into a long story of how you manage money, save that for later. Write an email so compelling that the person reading it would truly believe it\'s worth their time to take a meeting with you by getting to the point very quickly. Put these tips into practice and you\'ll find that, over time, the number of meetings your team is setting has increased exponentially.', 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'How to Write an Effective Investment Sales Email That Gets the Meeting', 'content': 'Let’s start off with a little story about how crazy the investment business is as it\'s related to email. Here\'s the deal - if you raise money for a living, you know one thing is true as true can be: you can\'t raise money without a meeting. You have to be able to get a meeting with a qualified buyer and a pool of capital. We work for these super-smart people: portfolio managers, great investors, great education, you get the picture — in fact, you probably live it every day. The question is, with all the emails that everyone receives, what drives them to open an email? How do you get a meeting? How does it all work? The answer is the subject line. At the end of the day, if we\'re tied to meetings and super-smart people who manage great portfolios, essentially what makes or breaks getting a meeting with them is the subject line. Why is that? Subject lines are what catch someone\'s attention and decide whether or not they even see the rest of your message. Then, if the email\'s well-written and includes a strong call to action, it just might elicit a response. In this article, we\'re going outline how you can craft emails designed to get a meeting. We’ll walk through through the three section every email needs, and what you should include in each. By the end of the article, you’ll know exactly what to include in your emails to get your point across and, most importantly, get the meeting. Section 1: the subject line At the end of the day, all investment sales people care about at the end of the day is one thing: getting meetings with qualified buyers. When we go into a city to schedule meetings, it\'s this simple: you get a meeting with a strong subject line. You have to get to the point. Take this for example: Say you’ll be in New York City on October 5th, so you make your subject line “meeting request for October 5th at 3:00 PM.” Now the person reading the email knows exactly what that email holds for them. They know you want a meeting with them because it’s crystal clear in the subject line. Now, if you want to increase your response rate, put the word “video” in the subject line. This concept hasn\'t gotten out there yet in the investment world. If you have a video introducing yourself, definitely include this in the email. Section 2: the body The second thing to focus on is what we like to call the JP Morgan Private Bank test. This is where we will say the recipient’s name and say exactly what we want or what we’re looking for. This part needs to be one sentence that packs a punch and illustrates the value of your investment firm. At Dakota, we tell our team to make this sentence extremely simple, while knowing that one sentence has to do a lot of heavy lifting. You have to make it count. Take this sentence for example: “Hello, my name\'s Gui Costin. I\'m calling from JP Morgan Private Bank. Unfortunately, your 99-year-old great aunt just died and left you a million dollars. Please reply to this email with your wiring instructions.” If it\'s a legit email, you\'re going to obtain a 100% response rate. What we mean by this is that you want to make sure you\'re really getting to the point in the most acute way possible, while bringing your strategy to life in one sentence. Think through what you can say that will be so compelling that the reader looks at it and says, "You know what? This is a meeting I want to take when this person is in town on October 5th at 3:00 PM." Section 3: the call to action So, you\'ve written your one powerful sentence and successfully introduced your firm. Now it\'s time to close out the email. This is where we\'ve seen a lot of salespeople fall down. The closing needs to have a very clear call to action. A lot of people say, "Hey, can you meet sometime on October 5th?" Or, "Can you meet sometime next week?" Even, "Can you meet sometime next month?" What\'s the problem with these closing? They\'re not giving anyone specificity. This gives them the opportunity to say, "No, I can\'t meet," and end the conversation right there. The key is to pick a specific date and time, something to allow room for the person to say yes, or to suggest an alternate time, rather than giving a simple "no." Why is this so important? Because our lives and our careers unfortunately live and die by the quality of our emails. The quality of our subject lines, the quality of that one sentence, and the power in that clear call to action. Make your emails count, and watch your meeting count climb Too many people write emails by rote, not taking the time to personalize their messages, or ask for what they want. Or, even worse, they write extremely long paragraph-by-paragraph explanations of their firm that go unread because they\'re overwhelming; they\'re trying to get everything they can into that one email. Don\'t be that person. Instead, think of email writing as an art. Your art is to write that one sentence. Make it so meaningful about your investment strategy that someone thinks, "You know what? Based upon what you just said, it sounds too compelling not to take the meeting." Your emails exist to obtain one result, and that\'s to book the meeting. Nothing else. You don\'t need to get into how your firm was founded. You don\'t want to get into a long story of how you manage money, save that for later. Write an email so compelling that the person reading it would truly believe it\'s worth their time to take a meeting with you by getting to the point very quickly. Put these tips into practice and you\'ll find that, over time, the number of meetings your team is setting has increased exponentially.', 'bullet_points': [], 'subsections': []}], 'key_takeaways': [], 'faqs': []}

# article_192_how-to-make-your-crm-your-most-used-asset-and-what

{'title': 'How to Make Your CRM Your Most Used Asset and What You Get in Return', 'introduction': "In the fast-paced world of modern business, a CRM stands as a pivotal tool, central to nurturing and expanding your relationships with prospects. A well-implemented CRM not only streamlines communication but also provides valuable insights into prospect preferences and behaviors, enabling businesses to tailor their strategies for maximum impact. It transforms raw data into actionable information, fostering a deeper understanding of prospect needs and driving sales growth. The importance of a CRM cannot be overstated; it connects a business with its prospects, ensuring sustained growth and success in a competitive market. In this article we are going over how to make your CRM your most used asset through measuring metrics. By the end of this article, you will know how a CRM can transform your company. Measurable metrics As one can assume, the first step in making your CRM your most valuable asset is getting people to login. The easiest way to do this is to make your CRM mandatory and have your team report on it. There are three metrics you can report on to ensure your CRM is getting used properly. These include usage metrics, data quality metrics, and performance metrics: Usage metrics: how many salespeople are actively using the CRM, and what for. This can include users logged in or not logged in, accounts created by role owner, opportunities created by role owner, contacts created by role owner, etc. Data quality metrics: how accurate the data quality in your CRM is. If the data within the CRM is bad, your sales team is not only less likely to use it, but less likely to fix it. These metrics can include opportunities with a close date, prospect accounts with missing information, accounts with all key fields populated, etc. Performance metrics: how effective your salespeople are using the CRM, its processes, and its strategy to achieve outcomes. Since the goal of a CRM is to make your firm more efficient, metrics to measure this include pipeline by owner or owner role, win ratio for current and prior year, deal type by owners winning, etc. At the beginning of every week, review activity and opportunity reports as a team. This allows everyone to have insight into progress, and ensures that the data within the CRM stays fresh. If you go to review your own KPIs and find things missing or incomplete, you will know that there is an adoption problem on your team. Don’t search for leads, be presented Salespeople have been hired strictly for sales. They should come in with their set plan for the day already knowing exactly who they are reaching out to. This is the sole purpose of your CRM: to present your team with leads instead of them searching high and low. Traditionally, salespeople spend a significant portion of their time identifying and researching potential leads. This process, while crucial, is often inefficient and diverts valuable time from actual selling activities. Studies indicate that 65% of a salesperson's time is spent on tasks other than selling, including lead research. A well-utilized CRM system is a treasure trove of efficiency. With instant access to prospect data, you can easily understand needs and identify the right moments for engagement. When a salesperson knows exactly who to reach out to and when, they spend less time sifting through data and more time in meaningful interactions with prospects. This is what will ultimately drive revenue and growth for your team. How your CRM transforms your company CRM systems hold the key to unlocking the potential of sales teams by reducing the time spent on researching leads. By providing salespeople with ready-to-use, high-quality leads, CRM systems enable them to devote more time to active selling and engagement. This shift not only enhances the efficiency of the sales process, but also contributes significantly to the growth and success of the business. A well-implemented CRM system will transform your firm’s sales process in several ways. Efficiency in Information Retrieval: CRM systems centralize prospect information, eliminating the need for salespeople to dig through files or old emails. This one-stop solution ensures that all data is readily accessible, saving time and effort. Targeted Outreach: CRM analytics enable sales teams to predict and identify the most promising leads. This precision ensures that their efforts are focused and effective, rather than random attempts to connect. Automating Tedious Tasks: CRMs will automate mundane tasks like scheduling follow-ups and managing contacts. This automation allows salespeople to concentrate on what they do best – engaging with prospects and closing deals. Streamlined Communication: By tracking all interactions, CRM systems help sales teams deliver personalized experiences. This fosters better relationships and trust, crucial for successful sales.

{'title': 'The Top RIAs in the Top 5 Metro Areas for 2023', 'introduction': "If you're in investment sales, you likely already know that one of the biggest problems of selling to the RIA channel is the sheer size of it. The RIA market across the United States consists of over 36,000 firms, which means that while there are more than enough to choose from when looking for new clients, narrowing down the list to only those that allocate to outside managers is going to be key.

To determine our list, we looked for three things: An AUM above $200 million A dedicated analyst team An RIA that actively allocates capital to outside investment management firms In this article, we're highlighting the top 5 RIAs in the top metro areas across the United States from our curated institutional investor database, Dakota Marketplace.

# article_345_7-common-mistakes-investment-salespeople-make-and

{'title': '7 Common Mistakes Investment Salespeople Make — And How to Fix Them', 'introduction': "If you’re in investment sales, you’re no doubt already familiar with the prolonged, high-stakes, high-pressure environment that is common within the industry. Whether you’re early in your career or a seasoned professional, we all feel the heat every now and again. We all slip up, make mistakes, and, hopefully, learn from them. There’s no avoiding making mistakes every now and then. Unfortunately, time and time again salespeople and sales teams make a series of similar mistakes that suppresses their results and squanders valuable resources. Irreplaceable time and effort is taken away. At Dakota we’ve been fundraising since 2006, started hiring salespeople in 2008, and since then, we've raised over $40B. However, this was not without our fair share of mistakes, trial, and error. In this article, we are going to cover the seven most common mistakes many experienced investment management sales professionals make, and what you and your firm can do to avoid these obstacles. By the end, you’ll have a clear idea of the next steps you and your team can take to avoid wasting time and money, and drive more business. Mistake #1: Failure to set accurate expectations No matter how much money you can raise, if the CEO, PM or head of sales has unrealistic ideas about how much can be raised how quickly, it only creates stress, tension, and disappointment. Not the ideal environment for peak sales performance – or for retaining good salespeople. How to fix it: Be as transparent as possible When it comes to sales, it’s important to set clear, measurable goals early. If you aren’t setting goals and communicating them to your boss, PM, head of sales, etc., you are most likely setting yourself up for failure. Instead, make it a habit to communicate and agree upon goals at the outset of a relationship, and report against that goal frequently. This will help you avoid surprises and build trust as you go. Mistake #2: Not targeting the right channels Salespeople love to brag about not taking “no” for an answer. But we believe “no’s” are an indication you’re not getting in front of the right buyers with the right product. We say: Don’t waste your effort fighting with “no’s” – seek out more “yes’s” by targeting the right channels. How to fix it: Stop being in the convincing business Knowing how to take “no” for an answer is part of being an effective sales person. There is far more success to be had by knowing the right channels, than by trying to convince the wrong ones. We’ve put this into practice at Dakota, and part of our sales ethos is “sell apples to apple buyers.” In short: don’t waste time convincing orange buyers they might like an apple. Mistake #3: Not knowing and growing the Total Addressable Market (TAM) Salespeople always want to be better at selling – which is the far end of the pipeline. But we have found that the real key to success in this business is how you feed the pipeline at its source. This is why I believe you need to be obsessed with your TAM, with the penetration of your TAM, and with tracking the growth of your TAM. Feed your pipeline and it will feed you. How to fix it: Understand your TAM The best way forward to sales success is knowing your audience. If you aren’t sure exactly what this is and how it relates to sales, we have a complete guide to TAM that will get your started on the right foot. Knowing your TAM and executing against it will save you time in the long run, because you won’t be wasting your days wondering who to call on. Instead, you’ll be able to work your way down a list of qualified prospects, and turn them from just prospects into leads and sales. Mistake #4: Failure to use Story to Bring Your Pitch to Life People relate to, are moved, and remember stories – not by piling on tons of forgettable facts and facts and figures. Think your product doesn’t have a story? I assure you that it does and I can show you how to find it. (Further in this letter, I’ll tell you one of my favorite and shortest examples of an investment story.) How to fix it: Become a master storyteller What makes you and your firm unique? What do you bring to the table that sets you apart? This is where you want to hone in. Find a part of your firm’s story that stands out, and delve into it. Anyone can make a sales pitch, but not every sales pitch is memorable. Not sure where to start when it comes to storytelling? We’ve got you. Mistake #5: Failure to Completely Control the Meeting If you aren’t in control of the meeting, that means it’s either being controlled by the prospect or literally out of control. Either way, that’s certainly not how you get what you need to optimize results. The good news is that prospects actually prefer that you control the meeting – if you do it correctly with the right kind of preparation. How to fix it: Know what to say It’s one thing to work to get a meeting with a prospect. It’s another to lead the meeting, make an impact, and build a relationship from there. If you’re not prepared going in, or open with a long monologue instead of starting a conversation, it’s likely to go off the rails. Instead, ensure that you know what to say. Learn about the prospect, prepare a short opening that answers the most commonly asked questions, and most importantly, start a dialogue. Mistake #6: Settling for “Great Meeting” Too many salespeople return to the office happy to have had a “great meeting.” But we deem any new prospect meeting a failure if it doesn’t uncover: 1. If and when they will be doing a search in your asset class 2. What the next step should be. This is why knowing the right questions – and knowing how to ask them – is such a critical skill. How to fix it: Make a plan to follow-up We all want to think our meetings were great. But if you leave someone’s office with a goodbye and a “great meeting,” the relationship is likely to end then and there. Instead, plan to follow-up directly after the meeting, and build out a plan to continue following up over time. This helps give both parties actionable next steps, and keeps communication open. At Dakota, we like to say that no meeting is “great” unless you left with a wire of millions of dollars. Which, as we all know, does not happen. So while “great meeting,” is a nice sentiment, it’s just that: a sentiment. Mistake #7: Failure to Log and Utilize What is Learned Anything uncovered in a meeting that doesn’t get entered into a CRM is worthless. Why? Because unless it’s in a CRM it can’t be used to trigger sales ideas, opportunities and actions. Fortunately, today’s technology makes it easier than ever for even the most technophobic salesperson to do it – with the right kind of training and motivation. Yet it’s surprising how few companies take advantage of this. How to fix it: Create a killer follow-up system Above, we mentioned the importance of following-up after a meeting. Now, we’re encouraging you to take it a step further. Create a killer follow-up system that allows you to stay on top of everyone you’ve met within the last 30-, 60-, and 90-days, so that nothing falls through the cracks. We've got a step-by-step methodology that will help you do just that. What to do next If any of these ring true for you, don’t worry — we’ve all been there. Start by knowing who to call on. Once you know who you should be reaching out to, you can finesse your messaging and storytelling, and work on building out your follow-up system. If you’re not sure where to start, or want further insight on any of the above, schedule a 15-minute consultation, we’d love to see how the Dakota team might work with you.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': '7 Common Mistakes Investment Salespeople Make — And How to Fix Them', 'content': "If you’re in investment sales, you’re no doubt already familiar with the prolonged, high-stakes, high-pressure environment that is common within the industry.

# article_324_the-2-major-reasons-crms-get-a-bad-reputation-and

{'title': 'The 2 Major Reasons CRMs Get a Bad Reputation (and How to Overcome Them)', 'introduction': "As an investment salesperson, you’re probably used to rolling your eyes when the word “CRM” is mentioned. We’ve all done it. CRMs have long since gotten a bad reputation within the industry. However, they are a necessary platform that can help you exponentially grow your business and increase your sales team’s productivity. At Dakota, we’ve used Salesforce CRM for over twenty years, and have raised over $50 billion in that time, something we wouldn’t have been able to do without the diligent use of a CRM. Now, we know what you might be thinking — the way I’m currently doing things is fine. And that is probably true. But it’s also true that it could be improved with the help of a CRM. In this article, we’re outlining the 2 major reasons why CRMs get a bad rap, along with the ways to overcome those challenges. You read that correctly — the reason why sales teams are so loath to use a CRM boils down to two things: bad data and bad design. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear understanding of how to combat the pushback and tension your sales team may be feeling in regards to using a CRM. First, we’ll jump into the most important reason: bad data. 1. They’re full of bad, stale, or incomplete data The one thing a salesperson needs to do B2B sales well is a database that’s well-organized and up-to-date. If a salesperson goes into their CRM and finds nothing but outdated leads, incorrect contact information, and incomplete data, chances are, they’re not going to be motivated to login and add their own accurate notes to it. In fact, they probably aren’t going to login at all if they know that’s all that’s in there. To overcome this, you as a sales organization have to prioritize putting clean data into the CRM in order to get value out of it. Then, once the sales team starts adding accurate, detailed information of their own, the rest of the team will see that there isn’t just outdated, stale data, but accurate and relevant contact information they can use in their outreach. This will take time and dedication to clean and accurate data, but the payoff will be huge for your sales team, giving them hours of valuable time back in their days. 2. The CRM is clunky to log into and isn’t laid out well This one is not the fault of the CRM or the salespeople — it falls on the organization to organize their CRM in a way that’s very useful for a salesperson. If the CRM is not well laid out, then it makes it even harder to input the necessary data to keep the sales team — and the organization — running smoothly. What happens when a CRM is set up poorly? Salespeople don’t adopt it, and the cycle begins again. It is incumbent on the sales organization to keep the data up to date. However, most places don’t see it that way, often because there is no dedicated budget to CRM setup and maintenance. While having someone on-staff full time can be an expense that many firms don’t have, however, you can start by asking your sales team what fields and setup they would find helpful within the CRM, what their must-haves and nice-to-haves are, and go from there. Additionally, while having a data administrator onboard is expensive, there are other ways to make sure the data going into the CRM is clean, like software platforms NeverBounce or Rocketreach. Additionally, most CRM apps require a lot of programming, setup time, and are still not easy for the salesperson to use. This means that they will most likely need to be in front of their laptop in order to enter meeting details and notes. Typically, this results in the salesperson waiting until the end of the day or even the end of the week or month to enter information. By this time, of course, the information and conversations are no longer fresh in their minds, and some get lost entirely. This leads to a never ending loop of frustration and missing information, and eventually means the difference between the organization getting their CRM adopted or not. What is the cost of a poorly managed CRM? Now that you know why salespeople are so reluctant to rely on their CRM, let’s talk about what it costs to have that loss of information. To keep it simple, we’ll think in terms of round numbers. Say your salesperson makes $100,000 per year, and each year they do roughly 200 meetings. t’s $500 per meeting by the time you factor in travel expenses and time. If that salesperson doesn't enter their meetings in the CRM, they don’t know how many meetings they’ve had, with whom, the types of meeting, etc., and they can't follow up effectively. This means they will not only lose deals they would have closed otherwise, but it makes it incredibly hard to replace them should they leave the firm. The incoming salesperson also will have no record of who has already been spoken to. At the end of the day, this means the firm just wasted that $100,000, because no one knows what’s happening in terms of meetings. So what can you do to make a CRM more useful to the sales team? This also comes down to two things: Update the contact information within the CRM Establish an easy to use UI for your CRM Once you can get past the updated data and organized UI, there are only two things that a salesperson needs to do to be effective from a data standpoint. Two critical things need to be captured: The meetings that have been scheduled by the salesperson. If you can do this, everything changes, because you’re able to see and report on dozens of things around that one specific activity. The call notes from those meetings.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'The 2 Major Reasons CRMs Get a Bad Reputation (and How to Overcome Them)', 'content': "As an investment salesperson, you’re probably used to rolling your eyes when the word “CRM” is mentioned.

# article_379_3-tips-for-following-up-after-an-institutional-inv

{'title': '3 Tips for Following Up After an Institutional Investor Meeting', 'introduction': "Picture this: you’re leaving a meeting with an institutional investor after doing outreach for months, and planning for the meeting itself for hours. The pitch went well, and they seem interested, even if your strategy is not an immediate fit for them. You shake hands, plan to keep communication flowing, and part ways again. For some, this might sound like a best-case scenario. And it can be, if you follow up properly after said meeting. However, many people in the investment industry — even seasoned veterans — often forget to do so entirely, or do so in a quick, forgettable way that is almost guaranteed to put them right back at square one: doing outreach and wondering what went wrong after a meeting that went so well. We’ve all been there. At Dakota, we believe in having a killer follow up system. We’ve been fundraising since 2006, and have raised over $35 billion since then. How? By following up, and then following up again. (And, a lot of strong relationships and hard work along the way.) The fact is that institutional investors get so many emails that if you follow up just once, attach a standard PDF, and then move on, they are most likely going to miss it. Stop sending emails into the ether, and develop a killer follow up system of your own. In this article, we’ll cover three of our best tips for following up after a meeting. By the end of the article, you’ll be able to craft an email that hits the mark, and helps you close business faster. How to follow up after a meeting 1. Reach out with same-day insights The key to this one is sending the follow up email the same day as the meeting. Don’t wait! Send this email while your pitch is still top of mind for the people you met with, creating an open line of communication between your firm and theirs. This email can include marketing attachments, but they shouldn’t be doing all the work. And, what’s more, the world is moving away from things like static PDFs. Investors increasingly want something that allows them to quickly and conveniently access all the information on your strategy. You can do this by directing them to your website, a video series, or other interactive media that give them all the information they need in one place. This initial outreach should also include additional details surrounding questions the allocators asked during your meeting, or expanding on answers given while you were doing your pitch. This not only shows that you’re really considering their needs, but lays the groundwork for the relationship going forward. 2. Log your completed meetings in your CRM A CRM is absolutely vital for easy follow-up and tracking after a meeting. Be religious about logging all information related to your activities, conversations and interactions with buyers. This is the when, what, where, and how that will allow you to create follow-ups that address an allocator's specific needs and stage in the buying process. This keeps your team organized, without letting anything slip through the cracks without follow up. You can also use your CRM to create custom drop down menus based on the characteristics of the accounts you’re meeting with. This allows you to easily categorize those accounts in reports, and break up the information so you can quickly and easily take action on next steps, whether that’s sending an email or booking your next meeting. Finally, create an opportunity for each account you meet with so that you can create opportunity reports broken down by name, title, email, and phone columns. This helps with additional organization, and allows you to sort by status, title, etc. when planning follow up outreach. 3 . Create pipeline reports Create a general pipeline report and multiple pipeline reports per channel (Bank/BD, Consultant, RIA, etc.), so you can see how you’re progressing by channel. This will help keep you on track, and allow you to prioritize outreach. Additionally, start creating meetings and call reports. You can break these reports up into meetings held within the last fourteen, thirty, and ninety days. This will give you a clear overview of the meetings and calls held and when for easy follow-up. The key to creating these activity reports is reviewing them regularly and taking action. They are great reminders that you need to continue to follow up. At Dakota, we call these reports “sales triggers.” By reviewing your past activity, it triggers you to take an action in moving that relationship forward. Putting it into practice Success in sales is highly correlated to how well organized you are. Putting systems in place to keep yourself on track and organized is the best way to do that. We’re all busy juggling meetings and outreach and prospecting. It’s easy for things to slip through the cracks, but they don’t have to. Start small. Create a repository of all the information allocators might want to review. This way, you have everything in one place, and can take action on the first point in our list. Next, get into the habit of creating opportunities for every meeting you have. Once you do that, you can start creating those informational reports, and making your outreach as streamlined as possible. Don’t let another opportunity slip away needlessly. Start small, get organized, and set yourself and your team up for continued sales success.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': '3 Tips for Following Up After an Institutional Investor Meeting', 'content': "Picture this: you’re leaving a meeting with an institutional investor after doing outreach for months, and planning for the meeting itself for hours. The pitch went well, and they seem interested, even if your strategy is not an immediate fit for them. You shake hands, plan to keep communication flowing, and part ways again. For some, this might sound like a best-case scenario. And it can be, if you follow up properly after said meeting. However, many people in the investment industry — even seasoned veterans — often forget to do so entirely, or do so in a quick, forgettable way that is almost guaranteed to put them right back at square one: doing outreach and wondering what went wrong after a meeting that went so well. We’ve all been there. At Dakota, we believe in having a killer follow up system. We’ve been fundraising since 2006, and have raised over $35 billion since then. How? By following up, and then following up again. (And, a lot of strong relationships and hard work along the way.) The fact is that institutional investors get so many emails that if you follow up just once, attach a standard PDF, and then move on, they are most likely going to miss it. Stop sending emails into the ether, and develop a killer follow up system of your own. In this article, we’ll cover three of our best tips for following up after a meeting. By the end of the article, you’ll be able to craft an email that hits the mark, and helps you close business faster. How to follow up after a meeting 1. Reach out with same-day insights The key to this one is sending the follow up email the same day as the meeting. Don’t wait! Send this email while your pitch is still top of mind for the people you met with, creating an open line of communication between your firm and theirs. This email can include marketing attachments, but they shouldn’t be doing all the work. And, what’s more, the world is moving away from things like static PDFs. Investors increasingly want something that allows them to quickly and conveniently access all the information on your strategy. You can do this by directing them to your website, a video series, or other interactive media that give them all the information they need in one place. This initial outreach should also include additional details surrounding questions the allocators asked during your meeting, or expanding on answers given while you were doing your pitch. This not only shows that you’re really considering their needs, but lays the groundwork for the relationship going forward. 2. Log your completed meetings in your CRM A CRM is absolutely vital for easy follow-up and tracking after a meeting. Be religious about logging all information related to your activities, conversations and interactions with buyers. This is the when, what, where, and how that will allow you to create follow-ups that address an allocator's specific needs and stage in the buying process. This keeps your team organized, without letting anything slip through the cracks without follow up. You can also use your CRM to create custom drop down menus based on the characteristics of the accounts you’re meeting with. This allows you to easily categorize those accounts in reports, and break up the information so you can quickly and easily take action on next steps, whether that’s sending an email or booking your next meeting. Finally, create an opportunity for each account you meet with so that you can create opportunity reports broken down by name, title, email, and phone columns. This helps with additional organization, and allows you to sort by status, title, etc. when planning follow up outreach. 3 . Create pipeline reports Create a general pipeline report and multiple pipeline reports per channel (Bank/BD, Consultant, RIA, etc.), so you can see how you’re progressing by channel. This will help keep you on track, and allow you to prioritize outreach. Additionally, start creating meetings and call reports.

{'title': 'Creating a Repeatable, Successful Sales Process: Principle 2 - Know Who to Call On', 'introduction': "In the dynamic world of sales, success hinges on more than just ambition and persistence; it requires creating a repeatable sales process. We understand the intricacies of this challenging field - marked by emotional ups and downs, extended sales cycles, and frequent rejections. At Dakota, we’ve created this repeatable process for our investment sales team. Our four core principles have led us to success, and provided 20 years of results helping us raise $35 billion. We review these principles monthly in our Rainmaker sessions with Gui Costin. This is a class for any investment sales professional as it lays out the blueprint for a winning sales strategy. No matter the experience level - wanting to touch up, wanting to learn tips and tricks, or new to fundraising - Rainmaker is a sales training program with proven results. In this article are diving into principle two to creating a repeatable sales process: know who to call on. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of the three things you’ll need to do in order to achieve this and how they will only help you reach your fundraising goals. To learn more about our four principles to sales, check out an upcoming Rainmaker Live! session with Gui Costin. Principle 2: know who to call on Sales is an arena filled with challenges - long cycles, frequent rejections, and intense competition. To navigate this landscape successfully, it's essential to first embrace this challenge. Next, it is critical that you know who to call on. To be successful, you must align your strategy with the most receptive channels. We call this your total addressable market (TAM). Identifying your TAM Your TAM is the first step to becoming successful, it’s the pool of people who buy what you sell. At Dakota we call this selling apples to apple buyers. When you’re in an arena of selling to buyers of your strategy, you find more success. It still won't be 100% accurate all the time, but it will lead to a lot more yes rather than no. City scheduling Once your TAM is identified, you can get started with city scheduling. This is something we have implemented into Dakota’s sales process since day one. It eliminates the need for coming into the office and creating your plan for the day, because you’ll already have it outlined. The simplest way for you to have a plan for the day is to put cities on the books. What we mean by this is to literally write a specific city on your calendar. Then you’ll put time slots of 9am, 11am, 1pm, 3pm, and 4:30pm. Using your TAM, you can easily segregate the people you’ll want to reach out to in Boston who  fit the channel and the product that you're selling. To get those 5 meetings, you’ll need to send 35 or 40 emails. While all of these people won’t answer you, they're still seeing your email, seeing your name, and seeing your brand - your  outreach is still making an impact. Always have 5-10 cities on the books at any given time to keep yourself structured and your schedule full. Writing your email As we touched on above, you’ll need to send around 35 or 40 emails in order to fill these time slots. But how do you write an email that gets a response? The answer is simple: a clear subject line. Subject lines are what catch someone's attention and decide whether or not they even see the rest of your message. Following the subject line, have 1-2 sentences in the body of your email and a call to action to round it out. Here’s an example: Subject Line: Meeting Request January 4th - 3:30pm Body: I will be traveling to Boston with Alan Breed, President of Edgewood, on 1/4 and would like to introduce ourselves. Edgewood manages approximately $30 billion in a 22-stock, high quality, large cap growth portfolio with weightings between 2% and 8% that has performed in the top decile of its peer group since 2006. Can you meet at 3:30pm on 1/4? Really pack a punch in the body of your email while being short and to the point. By ending your email with a clear call to action, you give them specificity and no opportunity to say “No, I can’t meet”. To summarize, incorporating these strategies requires a thoughtful approach. By consistently applying these principles and refining your methods based on feedback and results, you can build a sales process that not only reaches but exceeds your goals. Remember, the key to sales success lies in understanding your market, planning your approach carefully, and communicating effectively. With these tools in hand, you're well on your way to achieving sales excellence.

{'title': 'The Growing Investment Opportunities in Artificial Intelligence, Digital Infrastructure, and Energy Transition', 'introduction': "In the past decade, three sectors have emerged as promising growth opportunities for private investments: artificial intelligence (AI), digital infrastructure, and the energy transition. Each of these areas represents not only technological advancement but also a shift toward a sustainable, interconnected future. As venture capital and private equity firms seek high-growth investments, they are increasingly drawn to these sectors for their potential to generate scalable returns. In this article, we are exploring the latest trends, key drivers, and data on private investments in AI, digital infrastructure, and energy transition. By the end of this, you'll have a better understanding of how these sectors are shaping the future of technology and sustainability, as well as the opportunities they present for impactful, high-growth investments. Artificial Intelligence (AI) AI has become one of the most attractive areas for private capital due to its potential to transform industries ranging from healthcare to finance. In 2023, private investments in AI startups totaled approximately $42.5 billion across 2,500 equity rounds. While this amount was slightly lower than in previous years, it reflects a resilience in AI funding, as the decline (10%) was notably less than the broader 42% reduction in overall tech venture funding (CB Insights). One of the most exciting areas in AI is generative AI, which focuses on creating new content using machine learning algorithms. Funding for generative AI startups made up 48% of total AI funding in 2023, a dramatic rise from 8% in 2022. High-profile investments by Microsoft in OpenAI, which received $10 billion, highlight the growing appeal of generative AI technologies for private investors (CB Insights). New call-to-action Areas of Focus Healthcare: Innovations in diagnostics, personalized treatment, and operational efficiency now account for a significant amount of all AI investments, especially as healthcare organizations adopt predictive analytics to improve patient outcomes. Cybersecurity: AI-driven tools are becoming essential in combating cyber threats, from anomaly detection to threat assessment. Financial Services: AI in finance is transforming fraud detection, customer profiling, and portfolio management, supporting industry growth and investor interest in this application. AI investments are driven by factors such as operational efficiency, scalability, and ongoing advancements in machine learning, which collectively provide a strong foundation for future growth. AI-powered automation is particularly attractive as it promises to optimize processes and enhance productivity across sectors, creating substantial returns for investors. Digital Infrastructure Investment in digital infrastructure has experienced significant growth in recent years, driven by the increasing demand for data centers, fiber networks, and mobile towers. Between 2019 and 2023, over $600 billion was invested in these sectors, highlighting their emergence as major components of global infrastructure deal flow (UBS). The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) and cloud services has further accelerated this trend, with the data center market specifically projected to expand from $416 billion in 2024 to $624 billion by 2029 (Financial Times). These developments underscore the critical role of digital infrastructure in the global economy and the substantial capital being allocated to support its expansion. Areas of Focus (UBS) Fiber Networks: Video conferencing and the broader digitalization of services are driving sustained demand for fiber networks. Growth rates have stabilized, but enterprise fiber for corporate clients and fiber-to-the-home (FTTH) networks remain attractive. Mobile Towers: The expansion of 5G networks necessitates a denser infrastructure of mobile towers, supporting growth in this area. Data Centers: The surge in AI adoption is propelling demand for hyperscale data centers to serve tech giants such as Microsoft and Google. Additionally, colocation data centers are positioned to benefit as more enterprises develop proprietary AI models. The exponential growth in digital infrastructure investments is driven by the rise of cloud computing, the expansion of IoT (internet-of-things) and the digital transformation of traditional industries. These trends require robust and scalable digital infrastructure, making it an attractive opportunity for private capital. The Energy Transition Investment in the energy transition, focused on shifting from fossil fuels to renewable and sustainable energy sources, has accelerated significantly in recent years, fueled by climate commitments, technological advancements, and supportive regulatory policies. In 2023, global investments in energy transition technologies reached $623 billion, with projections suggesting annual investments could exceed $1 trillion by 2030 (BloombergNEF). As new technologies make renewable energy more cost-effective and scalable, private equity and venture capital firms are actively investing in companies and projects that will enable a low-carbon economy. Key private equity players have dedicated funds to support sustainable energy initiatives, underscoring the importance of this sector. New call-to-action Areas of Focus Renewable Energy Generation: This encompasses solar, wind, and geothermal projects. Investments in renewable infrastructure are crucial for expanding clean energy capacity and reducing reliance on carbon-intensive energy sources. Energy Storage and Battery Technology: Energy storage solutions, particularly battery technology, are essential for stabilizing renewable energy supply, as they allow excess energy generated by renewables to be stored and used during periods of high demand or low generation. Electric Vehicle (EV) Infrastructure and Green Mobility: As electric vehicles become more mainstream, investment in EV charging infrastructure and other green mobility solutions has become essential. Investments in energy transition are motivated by environmental goals, government policies, and technological advancements. Policies like The Inflation Reduction Act and the European Green Deal provide substantial incentives for clean energy investments, while corporate ESG commitments are driving demand for sustainable energy solutions. Private Equity Firms in Focus Below are some private equity firms actively investing in these transformative sectors: Macquarie Asset Management: Through its Green Investment Group (GIG), Macquarie Asset Management has been at the forefront of accelerating the transition to net-zero emissions by developing and managing a diverse portfolio of renewable energy assets. DigitalBridge: DigitalBridge is a leading global alternative asset manager specializing in digital infrastructure investments. The firm focuses on sectors such as data centers, cell towers, fiber networks, small cells, and edge infrastructure. Insight Partners: Insight Partners, a prominent global venture capital and private equity firm, has significantly invested in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) sectors. Since 2014, the firm has allocated over $4 billion to AI/ML companies, underscoring its commitment to fostering innovation in these fields (Insight Partners). Forging Ahead Investments in AI, digital infrastructure, and the energy transition represent the convergence of technology, connectivity, and sustainability in shaping a more resilient and innovative future. Each of these sectors is not only transformative on its own but also deeply interconnected, amplifying growth and creating cross-sector synergies. This interconnectedness creates a robust investment landscape, where advancements in one sector drive growth in the others, positioning AI, digital infrastructure, and energy transition as leading areas of opportunity for private capital.

# article_193_dynamics-driving-investment-opportunities-in-famil

{'title': 'Dynamics Driving Investment Opportunities In Family Offices', 'introduction': "In the intricate world of wealth management and investment, family offices stand out for their distinctive approach to handling and growing their assets. Understanding the dynamics that drive investment opportunities in family offices is key for anyone in the financial sector. The influence of family offices in the global investment landscape is growing. Their significant capital and the increasing sophistication of their investment strategies make them key players in various sectors, including real estate, technology, and sustainable investments. This shift is reshaping the way investments are approached and managed in the private sector. In this article, we’re covering the key dynamics driving investments in family offices. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of these dynamics and how to approach family offices. Direct Deals and Co-Investments One of the most defining characteristics of family offices is their liking for direct deals and co-investments. Unlike traditional investment firms, family offices often bypass intermediaries to directly engage in investment opportunities. This approach not only gives them greater control over their investments but also aligns closely with their specific interests and objectives, allowing for a more tailored investment experience. Discretion and Privacy Family offices typically operate under a veil of discretion and privacy. This preference stems from the personal nature of their wealth and a desire to maintain a low profile. Not only does this protect the family's privacy, but it also provides a strategic advantage in negotiations and investment decisions, as their moves are not always in the public eye. Opportunistic and Individualized Investment Strategy Family offices are renowned for their opportunistic approach to investments. Their strategies are not set in stone; rather, they are fluid and adaptable, often focusing on niche opportunities that might be overlooked by mainstream investors. This approach is driven by the desire to find the best possible opportunities that align with their specific investment philosophy. Long-Term Investment Horizon Family offices tend to operate with a long-term investment horizon. This perspective is deeply rooted in their goal of wealth preservation across generations. It influences their risk appetite, leading to more cautious and strategic investment choices that prioritize long-term growth and sustainability over short-term gains. Aligning Investments with Family Values Investments in family offices are often made in alignment with the family's values, legacy, and long-term goals. This could manifest in various forms, from a focus on sustainable and responsible investing to preferences for sectors and industries where the family has a historical interest or expertise. By making sure you’re in alignment with a particular family office’s values, you are instilling trust within the decision-makers. Building trust and educating family office decision-makers about potential investments are crucial. Family offices value long-term relationships with investment managers who understand their unique needs and can provide personalized advice and opportunities. Navigating the Unique Challenges While the opportunities are abundant, working with family offices also presents unique challenges. The highly personalized nature of these entities means that one-size-fits-all strategies are ineffective. Investment professionals need to understand the specific nuances of each family office, which requires a deep dive into their history, values, and investment philosophies. Understanding the dynamics of family offices is crucial for any financial professional looking to engage with this unique and influential segment of the investment world. The approach to investment in family offices is characterized by a high degree of personalization, long-term thinking, and a focus on alignment with family values. For investment professionals, tapping into this world requires not just an understanding of these dynamics we ran through, but also a commitment to building trust. This is critical to offer customized solutions and align with the long-term goals of these family entities. As the investment landscape continues to evolve, family offices are set to play an increasingly significant role. By embracing the unique opportunities and challenges they present, investment professionals can unlock new avenues for growth and impact in their careers and the broader financial world.

# article_045_the-top-form-adv-reports-to-leverage-rias

{'title': 'The Top Form ADV Reports to Leverage RIAs', 'introduction': "If you’ve ever found yourself sifting through the SEC’s website in search of Registered Investment Adviser (RIA) data, you know it’s not exactly a walk in the park. The process can be clunky, frustrating, and anything but intuitive. We get it - nobody has time for that when you’re trying to crush your fundraising goals. That’s why Form ADV data, while incredibly valuable, often feels out of reach without the right tools. Form ADV is a treasure trove of information that RIAs are required to file with the SEC. It reveals details about their business practices, client bases, AUM, and more. This information is pure gold for fundraisers looking to build better outreach strategies, target the right prospects, and close more deals. At Dakota, we’ve taken this pain point and turned it into an opportunity with Dakota Marketplace. Think of it as the ultimate hack for making Form ADV data not only accessible but also actionable. No more endless scrolling or wrestling with an unfiltered search – our platform organizes everything into a filterable, searchable database designed to make your life easier. In this article, we're going to review the top Form ADV reports to leverage for fundraising efforts. By the end of this, you'll have a better understanding of these reports and how they can help you with your outreach efforts. 1. Custodians RIAs’ custodian choices directly impact whether an investment firm can engage with them. For example, if your firm is approved at LPL, you can only call on RIAs that custody at LPL. However, if an RIA uses Schwab or Fidelity, they are typically more flexible, allowing most investment firms to connect without requiring pre-approvals. How It Helps: This report enables you to focus your outreach on RIAs whose custodians align with your firm’s approvals, saving time and ensuring more meaningful conversations. 2. AUM – Discretionary vs. Non-Discretionary Not all AUM is managed the same way. RIAs with discretionary AUM can make investment decisions on behalf of their clients without prior approval, while those with non-discretionary AUM require client sign-off for every move. How It Helps: Targeting RIAs with discretionary AUM lets you engage decision-makers who can act swiftly. Meanwhile, understanding non-discretionary RIAs allows you to tailor your approach to help them sell your strategy to their clients. 3. Client Base RIAs’ client bases vary — some cater to pensions, others to high-net-worth individuals, or even retail investors. Each group has unique investment needs. How It Helps: This report helps you identify the type of clients an RIA serves, so you can position your strategy as the perfect solution. For example, pensions might require steady, risk-averse strategies, while high-net-worth clients may gravitate toward sophisticated or niche investments. 4. Selection of Outside Managers Some RIAs run internal investment strategies, while others rely on external managers to handle investments for their clients. This report highlights those outsourcing decisions. How It Helps: RIAs that outsource are prime candidates for your investment products. This report saves you from wasting time on RIAs unlikely to engage external funds, focusing instead on those already open to partnerships. 5. RIAs With Private Funds Private funds often act as feeder vehicles into larger investment opportunities. Identifying RIAs managing these funds is a powerful way to tap into these structures. How It Helps: This report pinpoints RIAs with experience managing private funds, making them ideal partners for sophisticated strategies or exclusive investment opportunities. 6. RIAs with Ultra-High Net Worth Clients RIAs serving ultra-high-net-worth clients work with individuals who can meet high investment minimums and are often open to sophisticated, high-potential strategies. How It Helps: This report allows you to focus your efforts on RIAs whose clients are more likely to align with your firm’s offerings. Whether it’s alternatives, private equity, or high-barrier-to-entry funds, these RIAs are great targets. 7. RIAs With Offshore Clients RIAs with offshore clients often manage investments for non-US individuals or entities. If your firm offers strategies in UCITs, these RIAs may be able to present them to their non-US clients. How It Helps: This report connects you with RIAs whose client base includes international investors, offering a way to expand your reach and diversify your fundraising opportunities. Start Leveraging These Reports! Navigating Form ADV data doesn’t have to be a frustrating, time-consuming process. With Dakota Marketplace, you have the tools to turn complex information into clear opportunities. These reports are designed to help you focus on the RIAs that are most aligned with your investment strategies, so you can spend less time searching and more time calling on the right people. Now is the time to take action. Dive into these reports, start filtering for the RIAs that meet your criteria, and refine your outreach with confidence. By leveraging Dakota Marketplace and these tailored insights, you’ll gain a competitive edge, strengthen your pipeline, and ultimately, achieve your fundraising goals.

# article_132_the-biggest-mistake-ceos-make-related-to-sales

{'title': 'The Biggest Mistake CEOs Make Related to Sales', 'introduction': "So, you’re either looking to hire or you’ve just hired a new VP of Sales. The question is: are you hiring them to execute their sales process or your company sales process? This article is to make you stop and think about this because I think it’s one of the most important decisions company leaders make. After all, isn’t the sales process the key factor driving growth of any business? At Dakota we have our own sales process known as the Dakota Way. Every new team member is trained to learn this and live by it. We’ve operated in this fashion since our founding in 2006, and have since raised over $40 Billion for our clients following the Dakota Way. In this article we are going to dive into this concept and why I believe it’s the biggest mistake businesses leaders make when hiring a VP of sales. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear understanding why even the best VPs of Sales need the CEO to fully own the structure of the sales process. First, we’ll tell you what the mistake is. The 100% preventable mistake The biggest, single mistake CEOs make as it relates to sales is not owning their sales process. As a CEO, you must own this process. Now, this doesn’t necessarily mean you have to sit in on every sales call or that your VP of Sales can’t run things over time. It simply means you need to create a process for your team, implement it, and have your VP of Sales execute it. Why is this so important you may ask? Because you’re in business. If your company is a direct sales effort where you’re selling a product, investment strategies, or a software product doing demos like we do at Dakota, your number one criteria is going to be how many first time demos or first time meetings you get with your product. Constantly you must be finding new, qualified buyers for meetings. Over time as you grow the number of first time demos you’re doing for prospects, you'll have to have a level of re-engagement demos. These will be your two critical numbers and it is your duty to have a process for how your sales team is getting them. The mistake I’ve seen time and time again is the CEO has no idea what the sales process is, what the numbers are, and why they matter. They completely outsource this task to the VP of Sales. The CEO hangs their hat on with the excuse, “I hired the VP of Sales and that’s their responsibility.” No, it’s not. The conventional wisdom is the CEO is a CEO; they hire the VP of Sales; the VP of Sales comes in and creates a sales process. Also wrong. That’s why there’s so many failed VP of Sales. At startup companies, 95% of the VP of Sales candidates aren’t a good fit for you. When you interview a VP of Sales you say, “This is the job. The job is to execute our sales process. If you don’t want to do so then don’t take the job.” They aren’t there to recreate a wheel you’ve spent a lifetime crafting. Sales process set in stone It is absolutely essential you have your sales process in place before hiring a VP of Sales. You put the sales process into place with all the metrics, details, structure, everything A-Z. Then you bring the VP of Sales and tell them it’s their job to execute the company’s sales process. That’s how you win. You measure them based on your numbers that you know matter most. That is the job of the CEO. We know what we’ve created works because we’ve proven it to work. Your job is to implement it. This is the infrastructure for sales. The CEO = responsible for growth As the CEO, you are the leader. At the end of the day it’s your job to own the growth of your company and growth process. In normal parlance this is the sales process. It’s critical you own this because it is do or die. You can be average, 1x, 5x, or 10x your process. Wouldn’t you rather be doing 5 to 10x more than what you could be? Own the growth process. You can’t expect as the CEO that any VP of Sales is going to have a full handle on this. If you do, you’ve gotten lucky. For the most part this is not the case, which is why the CEO must own their sales process. I can lay out what this process should be as I’ve created it twice for a fundraising and investment organization. I own my sales process and wouldn’t let anyone mess with it, change it, or modify it. Now, there can obviously be slight modifications to improve this process, but nonetheless I would need to approve these. I make everyone accountable for the numbers. If you don’t feel comfortable that you understand sales, you have to find a guy like me or someone like our firm that can guide you. But the most important thing is for you to define and own your sales process and it needs to be very clear and repeatable, which ours is. Get started on setting your team up for success If you’re a sales leader and you’re struggling to define your sales process, we’d love to help you through that process. Ready to get started?

The question is: are you hiring them to execute their sales process or your company sales process? This article is to make you stop and think about this because I think it’s one of the most important decisions company leaders make. After all, isn’t the sales process the key factor driving growth of any business? At Dakota we have our own sales process known as the Dakota Way. Every new team member is trained to learn this and live by it. We’ve operated in this fashion since our founding in 2006, and have since raised over $40 Billion for our clients following the Dakota Way.

# article_080_cold-outreach-the-secret-to-winning-with-rias

{'title': 'Cold Outreach - The Secret to Winning with RIAs', 'introduction': 'Cold outreach is a fundamental tool for any investment sales professional looking to engage with Registered Investment Advisors (RIAs). While many avoid cold calling or emailing due to fear of rejection, this approach is critical for building successful relationships with RIAs. We’ve experienced this firsthand at Dakota, as we’ve been in the field ourselves raising over $35 billion since 2006. However, we are here to tell you to send the email and make the phone call, it will be worth it in the long run. In this article we are going to review why cold outreach is fundamental if you’re calling on RIAs to raise money. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of how to approach cold email outreach as well as cold calling. Cold outreach matters Cold outreach should be a cornerstone of your sales strategy when targeting RIAs. Despite their busy schedules, RIAs are constantly seeking new and innovative strategies to help them retain clients and attract new ones. With due diligence analysts at RIAs dedicating only about 20% of their time to researching new investment strategies, they have limited bandwidth for discovery. This is where sales professionals can provide significant value. RIAs often rely on sales outreach to stay informed. Many of them discover new strategies because a salesperson made the effort to reach out via a cold email or call. While they may not have time for numerous meetings, they do appreciate receiving thoughtful insights that can help them stay competitive. RIAs view sales professionals as extensions of their research teams – with limited time to vet new opportunities, they appreciate the direct access to innovative strategies that cold outreach provides. In many cases, RIAs may never have discovered a specific offering if not for a proactive email or phone call. By positioning yourself as a valuable resource and regularly sharing new ideas, you become an essential part of their investment decision-making process. Crafting an effective investment sales email When targeting RIAs, the effectiveness of your email can make or break your outreach strategy. Here’s how to ensure your email stands out: Subject Line: The subject line is the first thing recipients see, and it must be direct. Mention a specific meeting time, like "Meeting Request: October 5th, 3:00 PM." Body: The content should be concise and impactful. Use one powerful sentence to introduce your firm and clearly communicate the value you bring. Think of this as the “JP Morgan Private Bank test” – what can you say in one sentence that makes your strategy so compelling that they want to meet? Call to Action: Close your email with a specific, actionable request. Suggest a specific date and time for a meeting rather than leaving it open-ended. For example, “Can we meet on October 5th at 3:00 PM?” is much more likely to receive a response than vague options like “next week” or “sometime soon.” By mastering these three sections, you significantly improve your chances of booking meetings and making your cold outreach efforts worthwhile. Leveraging cold calling for success Cold calling can be intimidating, but it remains one of the most effective ways to engage with RIAs. To succeed, it’s important to have a strategy and a concise script that captures the recipient’s attention quickly. Here are a few key elements to consider when making a cold call: The Script: Keep it short and to the point. Introduce yourself and your firm within the first 15 seconds. For example: “Hello, my name is [Your Name] from [Your Firm]. We’ve never spoken before, but we partner with boutique investment managers across long-only equity and private alternatives. I will be in [City] on [Date], can you meet at 9 AM?” Differentiation: Highlight what makes your offering stand out. Mention your product’s unique attributes or how well-established your firm is within the industry. This differentiator should be compelling enough that the recipient is intrigued to learn more. Ask for the Meeting: Don’t over-complicate the ask. Be clear about the date and time you’d like to meet. Follow up with a brief email within five minutes after the call to reinforce the conversation and keep the momentum going. Start your cold outreach today Cold outreach is more than just a strategy, it’s the foundation for building strong RIA relationships. With the right mix of persistence, courage, and consistency, you can unlock success and create long-lasting partnerships. At Dakota, we’ve proven it works, and now it’s your turn. Start sending those emails, making those calls, and positioning yourself as a valuable resource to RIAs. The results will speak for themselves.

# article_333_top-10-ria-firms-in-the-cincinnati-metro-area

{'title': 'Top 10 RIA Firms in the Cincinnati Metro Area', 'introduction': "If you're in investment sales, you likely already know that one of the biggest problems of selling to the RIA (Registered Investment Adviser) marketplace is the sheer size of it. The RIA market across the United States consists of over 36,000 firms, which means that while there are plenty to choose from when looking for new clients, narrowing down the list to only those that allocate to outside managers is going to be key. Here at Dakota, we’ve raised over $6 billion from over 350 RIAs, and that has been possible because we qualify and curate our list to only RIAs that allocate to outside managers. In an effort to help narrow down the sheer size of the market, we’ve put together a list of the top 10 RIAs in each major metro area across the country.

Some stats on the asset classes launched: High level asset class: 37% of new launches in 2022 were equity, and 22% were fixed income related Equity large core 46 funds High yield bond 23 funds Leveraged/trading equity 23 funds Tech sector equity with 22 funds, something we have not seen in a while in being sector specific. 36 funds were launches with an ESG focus or bend, the majority actively managed. 2022 saw fund closures almost double from last year going to 145 ETFs liquidating, against 79 in 2021. The majority of these were niche, thematic strategies which had not added alpha over the passive alternatives, and simply did not attract assets as a result ie applying multi-factor to just a financial sector ETF was too narrow for many allocators. Blackrock/iShares rolled out more ETFs than any other issuer launching a total of 20 ETFs, and BondBloxx, a newer manager that focuses on fixed income, launched its first products in 2022 and came in second with 19 ETFs and roughly $540 million in assets under management. Nine active-non/semitransparent ETFs came to market in 2022, with a total of 55 now outstanding. This overlay was expected to be very popular among managers wishing to have their trades somewhat hidden, but acceptance continues to lag in real world usage. The universe of actively managed strategies continues to grow as there are now 1,005 actively managed ETFs, approximately 30% of all ETFs are actively managed, which include another 17 mutual funds which converted to active ETFs during 2022. image-png-3 Flow wise, interesting to note that the top 10 newly launched ETF gathering assets in 2022, all were equity based. Active ETFs took 14% of inflows, but are still less than 4% of total ETF assets. Screen Shot 2023-02-27 at 3.57.12 PM For the full year, almost $87 billion went into actively managed ETFs. Under the hood however we saw almost half go to ETFs from DFA, American Century, JP Morgan AM and Capital Group. 14% of inflows despite comprising less than 4% of total ETF assets Equity Approaches: passive, smart beta, active? While all three categories received positive net flows in 2022 allocators are fueling more organic growth via the smart beta and active approaches. The Dividend factor took in over half of smart beta flows at $67 B in as allocators sought income/cash flow from their equities, with buffered “defined outcome “coming in second at $10 B in flows. These buffered ETFs allow an easy way for an allocator to introduce hedging to portfolios without handling individual options which are hard to scale across multiple clients and risk tolerances. Screen Shot 2023-02-27 at 4.03.35 PM Looking at the top five active ETF in-flows in 2022 on an individual issue basis, they had a yield focus either with dividends, options overlay, or positioning on the yield curve to capture fixed income yield. The top five induvial active ETFs for out-flows had two themes in common: Where the Fed is and potential impact on the credit cycle drove redemptions out of lower quality fixed income. Losses across the bulk of the fixed income market allowed allocators to harvest losses in fixed income ETFs where duration had impacted performance and lock in losses, something which has not occurred in years for fixed income. Screen Shot 2023-02-27 at 4.05.39 PM Shifting to the top 5 passive ETF in-flows and out-flows in 2022 on an individual issue basis, at first glance it appears allocators just swapped one ticker/cusip for another to capture the tax-loss but maintained exposure to that sub-asset class with two key differences: Shifting from the TIP/inflation ETF to TLT 20+ Treasury ETF was a sign that allocators felt that inflation was peaking and long-term government bonds were now attractive. Shifting from the iShares MSCI USA Value Factor into the Schwab Dividend ETF showed that allocators were not selling value equities in all, but sharpening their focus to strategies where dividends were the major factor.

# article_122_how-to-use-city-scheduling-for-investment-sales-su

{'title': 'How to Use City Scheduling For Investment Sales Success', 'introduction': "For investment sales professionals, meetings are crucial. Getting your name in front of firms is just the beginning. To succeed as an investment firm, you need to schedule and secure those meetings. We understand that fundraising is challenging. That's why we're here to share our best practices for maximizing your time effectively during the day: city scheduling. Dakota has been successfully implementing city scheduling for years, ever since our first salesperson began. Since 2006, we've raised over $30 billion, leveraging city scheduling to plan and organize meetings. Before we delve into city scheduling, it's essential to understand that half the battle is knowing who to contact. When you have a clear list of contacts, you'll be more successful in engaging with your total addressable market (TAM) and securing meetings. The key is to request meetings with firms in every city you visit. This approach not only keeps your sales team focused but also maximizes their time and efficiency. In this article, we'll dive into city scheduling and explain how it can lead you and your firm to success. By the end, you'll know how to supervise your sales team with a strategic plan and the tactics for effective city scheduling. Have an outlined plan for the day A lot of time is wasted at the start of an investment sales person’s day simply because there isn’t a daily plan in place. It could take an hour or two just to figure out the day's tasks. City scheduling eliminates any uncertainty about what needs to be done. Start by putting cities on the books. What we mean by that is literally choosing a city, selecting a date, writing it down, and creating five empty time slots. These will be the times you request in your email asks. For example, put in your book that you're going to Boston on October 8th. With this set lead time, you know you're going to Boston. Between setting the date and your departure, your goal is to secure as many meetings with qualified buyers within your TAM as possible. This is where having a compelling email is crucial. Ensure your email includes a strong subject line, a meeting request, a brief one to two sentence introduction of yourself and your firm, and a clear call to action: “Can you meet at 9am on October 8th?” Don't be afraid to go through all of your contacts – to secure five meetings, you might need to send 35 or 40 emails. Even if recipients don’t respond immediately, they still see your email, your name, and your brand. This outreach, though seemingly small, has an impact. Also, just because someone doesn't want to meet now doesn't mean they never will. This is why persistence and consistency with city scheduling are essential. Schedule your key cities four times a year. As you set meetings in a city, it's critical to have a complete database of all the allocators in that city or those that fit the channel and product you're selling. So, with Boston on your schedule, you can plan your meetings in two-hour increments: 9:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 1:00 PM, 3:00 PM, and 4:30 PM. This structured approach makes city scheduling straightforward. It’s that simple: you're now city scheduling. How to put it into practice The strategy with city scheduling is to have between 5 and 10 cities on the books at any given time. This removes any opportunity for a salesperson to have any idle time. It has proven effective that they will come into the office and have a clear focus that they're always trying to schedule for certain days. By sitting down several weeks in advance and going through each metro area and circling times, it gives a salesperson purpose and focus. You’ll go through your entire TAM in each metro area and try to book those meetings. Leveraging Dakota Marketplace to city schedule Navigating through extensive lists can be overwhelming, but organizing by specific metro areas makes it manageable to connect with your potential LPs. That's why we've implemented the Metro Area tab in Dakota Marketplace – to streamline city scheduling and categorize a metro area by various asset classes. For instance, if you're looking to find all RIAs in Chicago, simply click into the Chicago metro within Dakota Marketplace. You'll see a comprehensive list of contacts in that area. Both our Investment Sales team and customers have found this feature incredibly useful for its ease of use and the ability to schedule last-minute meetings! This tool allows you to book additional meetings, identify firms that align with your investment strategy, and connect with due diligence professionals based in specific cities.

{'title': 'How Investment Sales Teams Can Use Social Media to Grow Their Business', 'introduction': "Social media might not be the first thing investment sales people think of when talking about their business. However, its importance should not be overlooked. Investment sales teams can use their knowledge and skills to create an impactful social media presence for themselves and their clients. In fact, 92% of financial advisors who use social media say that social media has helped them gain new clients. Companies use social media for a variety of purposes, but at the end of the day, it should provide content that keeps customers engaged.

By the end of the article, you’ll understand what to do next regarding creating a social media strategy that will deliver value to your company and your customers. First, let’s dive into why social media is important for any business. Why is Social Media Important? Social media is an integral part of any company’s success, and we’ve used several practices to help us build stronger connections with our customers. The primary social media platform we use is LinkedIn, and as a result, we have increased our brand recognition using it. We try to build relationships by posting for our ideal clients. We post biweekly and our posts are geared toward our clients to get them excited about events such as Dakota Live! Speaking of excitement, there is nothing more exciting than working somewhere where everyone feels welcomed, and that is how we use Instagram. This is where we create our buyer persona to attract new customers. We post on Instagram to show others what we do as a company and gear our posts toward potential new hires. Sometimes, you may even find some Instagram posts that feature our employees at our Dakota Cocktails events. Showing others what you do and how you do it will go a long way toward getting people to know about your company. Another platform we use is YouTube. From teaching viewers investment sales terms to showcasing what it is like to work at Dakota, our YouTube videos have a wide variety of content that will engage our customers in what we do on a daily basis. Engaging customers is vital for any business, and we love to connect to our customers using Twitter. Many financial advisors and companies are active on Twitter, and that is why we use it to promote Dakota Live and Dakota Cocktails events. At Dakota, social media allows us to track more information and gauge customer engagement. It paves the way for customers to easily reach us, and we want to keep them coming back. This brings us to our next point: how to get started with your social media plan. How to use social media to start growing your business Starting to use social media is not easy for anyone, but here are some tips and tricks to help you get started. Creating a social media action plan requires planning and preparation, and here are four steps that investment sales teams should use to do this: 1. Assigning a social media manager This person should develop the social media strategy for the company and figure out how to execute it. 2. Think about compliance When it comes to social media, financial advisors use it differently than other businesspeople, so make sure you are compliant with rules and regulations. 3. Conduct market research and create a strategy for your firm Social media does not have to be run in a specific way. Make sure that you use social media to your company's advantage so that you can target potential customers and connect with your current ones. Instead of posting just to post, try to solve an investor’s problem! 4. Execute Executing may sound like a lot, but using content tailored to your firm will help you achieve a successful social media presence. Following the four steps above will help you get off and running with your social media plan. Over time, you can use social media to have engagements with customers so that they can access your website and other social media accounts. At Dakota, we are figuring out when and what to post to best reach our customers. Posting on Tuesdays and Thursdays might be better than posting on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays. The content of each post should be geared toward customers, and we have demonstrated that through culture posts on Instagram, customer-focused posts on LinkedIn and promotional posts on Twitter. Which social media platform is right for your firm? A critical decision that investment salespeople have to make regarding social media is which platform(s) to use. Using one primary app might be beneficial for some, but others might use multiple platforms to reach different audiences. LinkedIn LinkedIn is impactful because companies can connect with their customers with a simple tap of the connect button on the app. Also, companies can post original content and optimize their profiles to improve their chances of being seen by others. We follow these guidelines by posting content that gets customers excited about company-related events. Youtube Another way we get customers excited about our company is through YouTube. We post videos that display our company culture as well as teach others concepts from the investment sales world. It may sound daunting to shoot video and get viewers, but there are ways to make sure your content stands out. Instagram If you want others to visualize working at your company, using Instagram is the best way to do so. While we use Instagram for “culture posts,” there are other ways investment sales teams can benefit from using the app. Some guidelines for using Instagram include showing and not telling, posting at certain times to gauge the best audience and boosting engagement. Twitter While Instagram is great for visuals, Twitter is great for communicating short blurbs of information. Tweeting, retweeting, replying and mentioning are four primary ways to communicate on Twitter, and it contributes to a fast way of communication with your customers. At Dakota, we use social media to strengthen relationships with our customers, prospects and everyone associated with the company.

# article_136_the-two-essential-reports-to-run-in-your-crm-for-s

{'title': 'The Two Essential Reports to Run in Your CRM for Success in Investment Sales', 'introduction': 'In order to 1x, 2x, 5, and 10x your fundraising efforts, there is one thing every investment sales professional should do: leverage their CRM. Dakota has been in the investment sales business since 2006 and raised over $30 billion, and we are here to tell you that CRM’s absolutely vital to your success. They are more than just digital Rolodexes; they are powerful tools that drive efficiency, improve client experiences, and enable strategic decision-making. A well-implemented CRM helps streamline your processes, keeping your sales team organized and on track. It allows you to store all your client interactions in one place, making it easier to manage relationships and ensure nothing falls through the cracks. With a CRM, you can easily track every touchpoint with a client, from emails and phone calls to meetings and follow-ups. This comprehensive view of client interactions helps in building stronger relationships and provides valuable insights for making data-driven decisions. There are many CRMs that are great for investment sales, and whether your CRM is Salesforce, Hubspot, Dynamics, Altvia, or Satuit- the two reports we are going to discuss in this article are possible. In this article, we\'re telling you the two types of reports that are necessities in order to leverage your CRM. By the end of the article, you\'ll have a clear path forward, and a better understanding of the benefits of using your CRM to the fullest extent. Meeting notes Before we even get started with the two reports you need to be running, let’s talk entering meeting notes. Entering your meeting notes into your CRM is one of the simplest, but most important things your sales team can do. However, in order to get your notes entered tends to be like pulling teeth. It\'s tedious, and most often sales people don’t want to go back and do this extra step. We cannot stress the importance of this enough. On our Rainmaker Podcast series, we have heard from investment sales leaders time and time again, "If it’s not in the CRM, it doesn’t exist”. Adding your meetings scheduled and your activity around these meetings is absolutely essential to your success. Continuing on with the theme of the Dakota Way, if you’re sending 15-20 emails a day and city scheduling - realistically you’ll be doing hundreds of meetings. Physically, your brain will not be able to remember all this information you’re taking in. This is why it’s so important to enter into your CRM! If you’re able to get the scheduled meetings into your CRM 100% of the time, there’s a ton of doors that will open for you. Once your scheduled meetings and notes are entered, you are able to remember everything and most importantly, you can run any type of report you want. This leads us to our next point - you can run activity reports and opportunity reports. 1. Activity reports To fully leverage the power of your CRM, it\'s crucial to create and regularly review activity reports. Start by setting up reports that detail your meetings and calls. Segment these reports into manageable time frames - meetings held within the last fourteen, thirty, and ninety days. This breakdown provides a clear snapshot of your recent activities and helps identify patterns and opportunities for follow-up. The key to maximizing the value of these activity reports is consistent review and action. By analyzing your past activities, you can pinpoint the next steps needed to advance your relationships. You’ll be setting up sales triggers for yourself. Sales triggers might involve following up on a previous conversation, sending an email, or scheduling a follow-up meeting. Perhaps you promised to send additional information or follow up a few weeks after an initial meeting. Regularly reviewing your activity reports ensures these triggers are not missed, keeping your sales pipeline active and engaged. Over six months, this consistent review and action can result in a significant number of follow-ups and interactions. The simplicity of generating these reports with a single click makes it an indispensable part of your sales strategy. For instance, you may recall a trip to Cincinnati last month, but upon reviewing your reports, you realize it was actually three months ago. Time flies, and without these reports, important opportunities may be overlooked. 2. Pipeline reports The second report that is essential for success in investment sales are pipeline reports. They are vital for providing a comprehensive view of your sales process and potential revenue. After generating your activity reports, the next step is to create detailed opportunity reports to track your progress and plan your strategies. Start by creating a general pipeline report that encompasses all channels. This report gives a broad overview of your entire sales pipeline at the click of a button, making it easy to share with your boss. It allows you to see the big picture, identify trends, and monitor overall progress. In addition to the general pipeline report, create multiple pipeline reports segmented by specific channels such as Bank/BD, Consultant, and RIA. These channel-specific reports provide deeper insights into how you’re progressing within each segment. This segmentation helps you prioritize your outreach and tailor your strategies to the unique needs of each channel. Consultant reports are particularly crucial for understanding where you stand in relation to your competitors. These reports can highlight your position in the market, helping you identify areas where you need to focus more effort. By knowing where you stand against consultants, you can better strategize your next moves and enhance your competitive edge. One of the key principles of the Dakota Way is setting clear expectations and maintaining alignment with your boss. Pipeline reports are instrumental in this regard. With a single click, you can access all your upcoming opportunities and review everything you’ve accomplished. This transparency helps in managing your boss’s expectations, ensuring that you are both on the same page regarding your progress and goals. Regularly updating and sharing these reports fosters open communication and strategic alignment. It ensures that your efforts are recognized and that any necessary adjustments can be made promptly to keep your sales process on track. Putting it into action By integrating regular activity reports into your routine, you ensure no detail is forgotten, every follow-up is timely, and every opportunity is maximized. This proactive approach not only keeps your sales process dynamic but also significantly enhances your ability to build and maintain strong client relationships. By leveraging both general and channel-specific pipeline reports, you gain the tools needed to drive efficiency, improve client experiences, and make informed strategic decisions. Your CRM, when used to its fullest extent, becomes more than just a repository of information—it becomes a powerful engine driving your sales success. Now, it’s time to put these strategies into action. Start by entering your meeting notes into your CRM and generating your activity reports. Schedule regular reviews to set up your sales triggers and keep your pipeline moving. Then, create your pipeline reports to gain a comprehensive view of your sales process, identify trends, and strategize your next moves. Share these reports with your team and your boss to maintain alignment and set clear expectations. By taking these steps, you’ll be on your way to significantly increasing your fundraising efforts and achieving success in investment sales.

# article_375_how-to-use-salesforce-to-create-a-killer-follow-up

{'title': 'How to Use Salesforce to Create a Killer Follow-Up System', 'introduction': "If you’ve ever found yourself staring down a pipeline of prospects, unsure what to do next or who to follow up with, you’re not alone. In fact, a lot of salespeople find themselves more than prepared for an initial meeting, and then fall short when it comes time to follow up after it ends. If you find yourself unsure of who you’ve already reached out to, who is waiting for outreach, and who it’s time to ping again after a lull, we've all been there. That creeping sense of disorganization is overwhelming, and can even cost your sales team opportunities as they try to figure out who to reach out to. The solution is, of course, getting organized. For most of us, that means implementing a Customer Relationship Management software (CRM), to keep us on track. But chances are, if you're in the process of researching a CRM for your investment firm, then you already have an idea of the value a CRM can bring to your business. From data integrity to better client service, a CRM can transform the way you do business every day, adding time back into your day and making meetings more productive. But most importantly, they give you clean and accurate data and a way to act on it. At Dakota, we’ve built a business out of compiling, cleaning, and curating our contact data. This practice has helped us raise over $35B since 2006. We’ve been using Salesforce as our CRM for fifteen years now, and have since created our own Salesforce App to coincide with our Dakota Marketplace platform. But don’t worry. We aren’t here to sell you our Salesforce App. Instead, in this article we’ll be covering the power that Salesforce can bring to your sales team, as well as how to use it to create a killer follow-up system. By the end of this article, you’ll be able to empower your sales team to use data, follow up effectively, and close more business. Why do I need a CRM? A well-maintained CRM can give your sales team up to five times their typical level of productivity, simply because they're not wasting time looking for people who buy what you sell. All of that information will be in your CRM. They are also no longer wasting their time trying to figure out who they’ve already met with, and who they need to follow up with. The secret to growth for any business is knowing your Total Addressable Market (TAM), and your CRM is the foundation needed to fuel that growth. Why Salesforce Specifically? There are a ton of databases and CRMs out there, and plenty that we’d recommend. But if you’re trying to decide between them, we can say that, having used Salesforce since 2001, our team has found Salesforce to be the most user-friendly CRM on the market. With over 150,000 customers around the world, and extremely customizable for the investment industry, Salesforce is one of the most widely-recognized CRM options available. There are countless use cases, customizations, and possibilities for you within their systems, and it can accommodate every team in your organization, from sales and marketing to IT.  This makes it a flexible solution built for scale. And finally, Salesforce’s reporting capabilities will help take your sales team to the next level. Is Salesforce right for my firm? In short, yes. While we know that a lot of CRMs, like databases, have a negative reputation within the investment industry, the problem is not with the platform, but the data within it. The misconception stems from the fact that most sales teams associate bad data with Salesforce. It comes down to getting serious about the data inside Salesforce. What does a CRM have to do with sales? When it comes to sales, follow up after the first meeting is critical. You can’t do anything before you set up a meeting with a prospect, but once that meeting ends, it all comes down to following up appropriately. To do that, you’ll need a CRM that lets you access all your past sales activities and follow up. Use reports within Salesforce to review all the meetings and calls you’ve had over a set stretch of time. This will give you a clear overview of what you’ve already done and when for easy follow-up. The key to creating these activity reports is reviewing them regularly and taking action. They are great reminders that you need to continue to follow up. At Dakota, we call these reports “sales triggers.” By reviewing your past activity, it triggers you to take an action in moving that relationship forward. You can’t be a successful salesperson without following up, and at Dakota, we believe you can’t follow up without a clear, targeted, follow up system. And it all starts with your CRM. Making the most of your Salesforce data and reporting Be religious about logging all information related to your activities, conversations and interactions with buyers. This is the data on who, what, when, where, and how that will allow you to create follow-ups that address an allocator's specific needs and stage in the buying process. This keeps your team organized, without letting anything slip through the cracks without follow up. However, the most important thing, after entering data, is the ability to access that data. Running actionable reports is what will make your sales team hyper-productive. One salesperson can punch with the weight of ten sales people if they have their data configured properly. Salesforce allows you to create activity reports across the last two weeks, thirty, and ninety days of activity, allowing you to set tasks and reminders for follow up. This is what will take your sales team to the next level. Once they can hone in on following up after those initial meetings, they’ll be able to stay on track and focus on closing more deals. What to do next If you’re not sure Salesforce is right for you, or how your firm might customize it to fit your needs, we have more resources about the importance of accurate data and following up that might help you take the next step in your decision-making process. You can also set up a call with one of our Salesforce consultants, who can talk you through your needs, and what a project like a CRM implementation might look like.", 'sections': [{'type': 'section', 'level': 1, 'title': 'How to Use Salesforce to Create a Killer Follow-Up System', 'content': "If you’ve ever found yourself staring down a pipeline of prospects, unsure what to do next or who to follow up with, you’re not alone. In fact, a lot of salespeople find themselves more than prepared for an initial meeting, and then fall short when it comes time to follow up after it ends. If you find yourself unsure of who you’ve already reached out to, who is waiting for outreach, and who it’s time to ping again after a lull, we've all been there. That creeping sense of disorganization is overwhelming, and can even cost your sales team opportunities as they try to figure out who to reach out to. The solution is, of course, getting organized. For most of us, that means implementing a Customer Relationship Management software (CRM), to keep us on track. But chances are, if you're in the process of researching a CRM for your investment firm, then you already have an idea of the value a CRM can bring to your business. From data integrity to better client service, a CRM can transform the way you do business every day, adding time back into your day and making meetings more productive. But most importantly, they give you clean and accurate data and a way to act on it. At Dakota, we’ve built a business out of compiling, cleaning, and curating our contact data. This practice has helped us raise over $35B since 2006. We’ve been using Salesforce as our CRM for fifteen years now, and have since created our own Salesforce App to coincide with our Dakota Marketplace platform. But don’t worry. We aren’t here to sell you our Salesforce App. Instead, in this article we’ll be covering the power that Salesforce can bring to your sales team, as well as how to use it to create a killer follow-up system. By the end of this article, you’ll be able to empower your sales team to use data, follow up effectively, and close more business. Why do I need a CRM? A well-maintained CRM can give your sales team up to five times their typical level of productivity, simply because they're not wasting time looking for people who buy what you sell. All of that information will be in your CRM. They are also no longer wasting their time trying to figure out who they’ve already met with, and who they need to follow up with. The secret to growth for any business is knowing your Total Addressable Market (TAM), and your CRM is the foundation needed to fuel that growth. Why Salesforce Specifically? There are a ton of databases and CRMs out there, and plenty that we’d recommend. But if you’re trying to decide between them, we can say that, having used Salesforce since 2001, our team has found Salesforce to be the most user-friendly CRM on the market. With over 150,000 customers around the world, and extremely customizable for the investment industry, Salesforce is one of the most widely-recognized CRM options available. There are countless use cases, customizations, and possibilities for you within their systems, and it can accommodate every team in your organization, from sales and marketing to IT.

{'title': 'The Best Institutional Investor Databases of 2021', 'introduction': "With the start of a new year comes the promise of new goals, new plans, and starting all over again on meeting quotas and closing deals with your firm. It’s as daunting as it is exciting. Here at Dakota, we know how difficult it can be, setting meetings and knowing who to call on, and how time-consuming it can be to research and handpick those people. We’ve done it for years ourselves, which is why we know how important it is to have a constantly growing total adjustable market (TAM). But more than that, it’s important to have a way to keep track of all your contacts, so that you never run out of people to call.

# article_177_creating-a-repeatable-successful-sales-process-pri

{'title': 'Creating a Repeatable, Successful Sales Process: Principle 3 - Know What to Say', 'introduction': "In the dynamic world of sales, success hinges on more than just ambition and persistence; it requires creating a repeatable sales process. We understand the intricacies of this challenging field - marked by emotional ups and downs, extended sales cycles, and frequent rejections. At Dakota, we’ve created this repeatable process for our investment sales team. Our four core principles have led us to success, and provided 20 years of results. We review these principles monthly in our Rainmaker sessions with Gui Costin. This is a class for any investment sales professional as it lays out the blueprint for a winning sales strategy. No matter the experience level - wanting to touch up, wanting to learn tips and tricks, or new to fundraising - Rainmaker is a sales training program with proven results. In this article are diving into principle three to creating a repeatable sales process: knowing what to say. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of how to master your pitch, as well as exactly what to do in the meeting to help reach your fundraising goals. To learn more about our four principles to sales, check out an upcoming Rainmaker Live! session with Gui Costin. Principle 3: know what to say Once you have done your homework of creating your TAM, city scheduling, and asking for the meeting - you have to know how to pitch your strategy. You have one chance to pitch yourself to the audience among you. What many people struggle with is landing a meeting, giving their presentation, and then walking out of the meeting with the audience having no idea what your strategy is. This is a waste of their time and yours. It is critical to create a story with your investment pitch that is easy to understand and retell, because these portfolio managers you’re presenting to are going to have to go back to their boss and pitch it again. Master the first 2 minutes Imagine the scenario: you’re about to head into your first meeting. You've invested significant resources - time, money, and effort - to secure a meeting with a key analyst or allocator. The stakes are high, the audience is knowledgeable, and the window of opportunity is narrow. In this high-pressure context, the clarity and impact of your message are paramount. The person sitting across from you will need to relay your strategy to an investment committee, colleagues, and clients. Your message, therefore, must be concise, memorable, and compelling. It's not just about what you say; it's about what they remember and repeat. This is the art of storytelling and mastering the first two minutes. The opening moments of any meeting are critical - these initial minutes set the tone and direction of the conversation. As a fundraiser, your goal is to center the conversation around the key points of your firm and strategy. This isn't just an introduction; it's a strategic overview designed to preempt fundamental questions and establish a solid foundation for the discussion. Key points to cover include: The firm's founding Location Assets under management Number of investment professionals Strategies managed Track record And a unique value proposition By succinctly addressing these points, you transition smoothly into the core of your presentation, focusing on the specific strategy you're there to discuss. The importance of practicing your opening remarks cannot be overstressed. A well-rehearsed introduction ensures that you convey all necessary information efficiently, allowing more time for in-depth discussion. This preparation prevents the meeting from being bogged down by basic inquiries that could have been addressed at the outset. It’s that practice that is required for each sales person to master the pitch. Follow up in the meeting Once the meeting has come to a close, traditional wisdom suggests that follow-up occurs after the meeting. However, The Dakota Way advocates for a more proactive approach. As the meeting draws to a close, it's crucial to ask two pivotal questions: Whether they see your strategy fitting into their asset allocation model. If they anticipate conducting a search in your asset class within the next 12 months These questions are not just formalities; they are strategic probes designed to gauge genuine interest and potential next steps. If the answer is no to the first question, then you have your answer - you can reach back out in a year. If yes, asking if they anticipate a search within the next 12 months makes you aware of a possible relationship.

We understand the intricacies of this challenging field - marked by emotional ups and downs, extended sales cycles, and frequent rejections. At Dakota, we’ve created this repeatable process for our investment sales team. Our four core principles have led us to success, and provided 20 years of results. We review these principles monthly in our Rainmaker sessions with Gui Costin. This is a class for any investment sales professional as it lays out the blueprint for a winning sales strategy. No matter the experience level - wanting to touch up, wanting to learn tips and tricks, or new to fundraising - Rainmaker is a sales training program with proven results. In this article are diving into principle three to creating a repeatable sales process: knowing what to say. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of how to master your pitch, as well as exactly what to do in the meeting to help reach your fundraising goals. To learn more about our four principles to sales, check out an upcoming Rainmaker Live! session with Gui Costin. Principle 3: know what to say Once you have done your homework of creating your TAM, city scheduling, and asking for the meeting - you have to know how to pitch your strategy. You have one chance to pitch yourself to the audience among you. What many people struggle with is landing a meeting, giving their presentation, and then walking out of the meeting with the audience having no idea what your strategy is. This is a waste of their time and yours. It is critical to create a story with your investment pitch that is easy to understand and retell, because these portfolio managers you’re presenting to are going to have to go back to their boss and pitch it again. Master the first 2 minutes Imagine the scenario: you’re about to head into your first meeting. You've invested significant resources - time, money, and effort - to secure a meeting with a key analyst or allocator. The stakes are high, the audience is knowledgeable, and the window of opportunity is narrow. In this high-pressure context, the clarity and impact of your message are paramount. The person sitting across from you will need to relay your strategy to an investment committee, colleagues, and clients. Your message, therefore, must be concise, memorable, and compelling. It's not just about what you say; it's about what they remember and repeat. This is the art of storytelling and mastering the first two minutes. The opening moments of any meeting are critical - these initial minutes set the tone and direction of the conversation. As a fundraiser, your goal is to center the conversation around the key points of your firm and strategy. This isn't just an introduction; it's a strategic overview designed to preempt fundamental questions and establish a solid foundation for the discussion. Key points to cover include: The firm's founding Location Assets under management Number of investment professionals Strategies managed Track record And a unique value proposition By succinctly addressing these points, you transition smoothly into the core of your presentation, focusing on the specific strategy you're there to discuss. The importance of practicing your opening remarks cannot be overstressed. A well-rehearsed introduction ensures that you convey all necessary information efficiently, allowing more time for in-depth discussion. This preparation prevents the meeting from being bogged down by basic inquiries that could have been addressed at the outset. It’s that practice that is required for each sales person to master the pitch. Follow up in the meeting Once the meeting has come to a close, traditional wisdom suggests that follow-up occurs after the meeting. However, The Dakota Way advocates for a more proactive approach. As the meeting draws to a close, it's crucial to ask two pivotal questions: Whether they see your strategy fitting into their asset allocation model. If they anticipate conducting a search in your asset class within the next 12 months These questions are not just formalities; they are strategic probes designed to gauge genuine interest and potential next steps. If the answer is no to the first question, then you have your answer - you can reach back out in a year. If yes, asking if they anticipate a search within the next 12 months makes you aware of a possible relationship. This approach saves invaluable time, allowing you to focus your efforts where they are most likely to bear fruit. Telling a compelling story and effectively communicating your message is the cornerstone of success in the competitive world of sales and investment management. By covering easy questions, engaging in conversations, and prioritizing the follow-up process within the meeting itself, you can ensure that your story resonates with your audience, leaving a lasting impression and increasing your chances of success.
