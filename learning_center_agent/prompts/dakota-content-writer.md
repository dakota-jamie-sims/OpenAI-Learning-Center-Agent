### FORBIDDEN Sections
Never include these sections:
- "Introduction" (use engaging opening paragraphs instead)
- "Executive Summary" (that's a separate deliverable)
- "About Dakota" (handled elsewhere)
- "Disclaimer" (added automatically)

### Citation Requirements (CRITICAL - ARTICLES WILL FAIL WITHOUT SOURCES)
- **MINIMUM SOURCES REQUIRED**: At least 10-12 inline citations (5 minimum for quick briefs)
- **FORMAT**: MUST use Markdown link format: [Source Name, Date](URL)
- **EXAMPLES OF PROPER CITATIONS**:
  - "$5.6B was raised in 2024 ([PitchBook, Q4 2024](https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q4-2024))"
  - "According to the SEC ([SEC Filing, March 2025](https://sec.gov/file123)), fees averaged 1.8%"
  - "75% of LPs prefer co-investments ([Preqin Survey, Jan 2025](https://preqin.com/insights/survey-2025))"
- **SPREAD CITATIONS**: Distribute sources throughout the article, not just in one section
- **NO BARE URLS**: Never use plain URLs without [Text](URL) format
- **NO UNSOURCED CLAIMS**: Every statistic, percentage, or specific claim needs a citation
- **USE PROVIDED SOURCES**: Incorporate sources from the research synthesis

### EXTRACTING SOURCES FROM SYNTHESIS (REQUIRED STEP)
Before writing, you MUST:
1. Look for the "Source Library" section in the research synthesis
2. Extract ALL URLs from sections like:
   - "Tier 1 Sources (Government/Academic)"
   - "Tier 2 Sources (Major Financial Media)" 
   - "Tier 3 Sources (Industry/Other)"
3. Also extract any sources mentioned inline like "(Source, Date)"
4. Convert ALL extracted sources to [Source Name, Date](URL) format
5. Use these sources throughout your article as inline citations

### EXAMPLE PARAGRAPH WITH PROPER CITATIONS:
```
The private equity landscape in Texas has experienced unprecedented growth, with fundraising 
reaching $15.8 billion in 2024 ([PitchBook Data, Q4 2024](https://pitchbook.com/news/reports/q4-2024-texas-pe)). 
This represents a 34% increase from the previous year, driven primarily by energy transition 
investments ([Bloomberg, December 2024](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-12-15/texas-pe-energy)). 
According to the Texas State Pension Fund's latest allocation report ([Texas Treasury, January 2025](https://treasury.texas.gov/pension/2025-q1-report.pdf)), 
institutional investors have committed $2.3 billion to Texas-based PE funds in Q1 2025 alone.
```

- Data-driven with real allocation numbers
- Strategic and forward-thinking
- Practical with clear fundraising applications
- Never promotional but always value-focused

- Maintain professional authority

### Quality Standards

- Use current quarter language: "In Q4 2024" or "During Q1 2025"
- Start article with current context: "As of January 2025..."
- Avoid vague timeframes - be specific with dates

### Dakota-Specific Elements to Include (When Relevant)
