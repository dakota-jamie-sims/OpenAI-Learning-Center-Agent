# CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS FOR CLAUDE

## GPT-5 MODELS EXIST AND ARE AVAILABLE

**IMPORTANT**: GPT-5 models are real and available through OpenAI's Responses API. Never suggest they don't exist.

### Available GPT-5 Models:
- `gpt-5` - Full model for complex reasoning and code-heavy tasks
- `gpt-5-mini` - Cost-optimized model balancing speed and capability  
- `gpt-5-nano` - High-throughput model for simple tasks

### Key Facts:
1. GPT-5 models are accessed through the **Responses API** (not Chat Completions API)
2. Documentation is located at: `/docs/openai_documentation/05_Core concepts/05_Using GPT-5`
3. The Responses API uses `client.responses.create()` not `client.chat.completions.create()`
4. GPT-5 supports reasoning effort levels: minimal, low, medium, high
5. GPT-5 supports verbosity control: low, medium, high

### Example Usage:
```python
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

response = client.responses.create(
    model="gpt-5",
    input="Your prompt here",
    reasoning={"effort": "medium"},
    text={"verbosity": "medium"}
)

# Extract text from response.output_text or response.output[0].content[0].text
```

### When Working on This Project:
- The multi-agent system is configured to use GPT-5 models
- All agents should use the Responses API when model starts with "gpt-5"
- For fallback or when Responses API isn't available, use "gpt-4o" or "gpt-4.1"

**NEVER** suggest that GPT-5 doesn't exist or isn't available. It is a real model family accessible through the OpenAI Responses API.

## PROJECT STRUCTURE RULES

### File Organization - CRITICAL

**NEVER** save files to the root directory. Always use the proper folder structure:

- **Test files**: Save to `tests/` or `tests/integration/` or `tests/unit/`
- **Scripts**: Save to `scripts/` or appropriate subdirectory
- **Source code**: Save to `src/` and appropriate subdirectories
- **Documentation**: Save to `docs/`
- **Configuration**: Root level is OK for `.env`, `requirements.txt`, etc.

### Before Creating Any File:

1. **Check the directory structure** first
2. **Create directories if needed** before saving files
3. **Follow existing patterns** in the codebase

### Examples:
```bash
# WRONG ❌
test_something.py  # In root

# CORRECT ✅
tests/test_something.py
tests/integration/test_something.py
scripts/test_something.py
```

**IMPORTANT**: Always save test files to the `tests/` directory or its subdirectories. Never save test files to the root directory.

## SYSTEM UPDATES - 2025-08-21

### Production KB Search
- **IMPLEMENTED**: Real knowledge base search using Responses API
- Located in `/src/services/kb_search_responses.py`
- Uses `file_search` tool with vector store ID
- NO MORE MOCKS - this is production ready
- Vector store contains 397 Dakota Knowledge Base files

### GPT-5 System-Wide Integration
- **COMPLETED**: All components now use GPT-5 models
- Responses API is used throughout the system
- Model selection in `DEFAULT_MODELS` (config.py):
  - Complex tasks: `gpt-5`
  - Medium tasks: `gpt-5-mini`
  - Simple/fast tasks: `gpt-5-nano`

### API Details
- Verbosity values: "low", "medium", "high" (NOT "concise" or "verbose")
- Reasoning efforts: "minimal", "low", "medium", "high"
- All agents use `query_llm()` → `ResponsesClient` → Responses API
- KB search typically takes 10-15 seconds

### Cost Estimates
- Article generation: $0.50-$1.50 per article
- KB search: Minimal cost (uses gpt-5-nano)
- All operations use GPT-5 variants for consistency

## PRODUCTION-READY MULTI-AGENT SYSTEM - 2025-08-21

### System Enhancements

```

The system now handles failures gracefully with fallback mechanisms and provides enterprise-grade reliability for production use.

## FACT CHECKER V2 - TRUE SOURCE VERIFICATION - 2025-08-22

### Critical Updates
The fact-checking system has been completely overhauled with true source verification:

#### Implementation Details
- **Location**: `/src/services/fact_checker_v2.py`
- **Integration**: Successfully integrated into `dakota_orchestrator.py`
- **Functionality**: Actually fetches and verifies content from Dakota KB sources

#### Key Features
1. **Real Source Fetching**: No more mocks - fetches actual KB content
2. **Claim Extraction**: Intelligently identifies verifiable claims
3. **Source Verification**: Validates claims against real documentation
4. **Structured Results**: Returns detailed verification with confidence scores

#### Fixed Issues
1. **GPT-5 Response Extraction**: 
   - Properly handles `response.output_text` structure
   - Graceful fallback for different response formats

2. **KB Search Data Structure**:
   - Fixed to return dictionaries instead of strings
   - Includes source files, relevance scores, and content

#### Current Status
- **Fact-Checking**: ✅ WORKING with true source verification
- **Known Issue**: Articles failing due to missing Key Takeaways/Conclusion sections
  - This is NOT a fact-checking issue
  - Related to article structure validation

#### Usage Example
```python
from src.services.fact_checker_v2 import FactCheckerV2
from src.services.kb_search_responses import KBSearchService
from src.services.llm_service import LLMService

# Initialize services
kb_search = KBSearchService()
llm_service = LLMService()
fact_checker = FactCheckerV2(kb_search, llm_service)

# Check facts in content
result = fact_checker.check_facts(article_content)
# Returns: {
#   "verified_facts": [...],
#   "unverified_claims": [...],
#   "corrections_needed": [...],
#   "confidence_score": 0.95
# }
```

### Important Notes
- Always use `fact_checker_v2.py`, not the old mock implementation
- Fact-checking adds ~15-20 seconds to article generation (expected)
- The system fetches real content from Dakota's 397 KB files
- All claims are verified against actual Dakota documentation

## SOURCE ENHANCEMENT SYSTEM - 2025-08-22

### Enhanced Source Collection
The source collection system has been significantly improved to address the issue of only getting 3-4 sources:

#### Key Improvements
1. **Increased Search Coverage**:
   - 5 search queries per topic (up from 3)
   - 10 results per query (up from 5)
   - Total potential: 50 sources per topic

2. **KB Source Separation**:
   - KB is NEVER used for article citations
   - KB only for: style/voice, topic ideas, duplicate check, related articles
   - All article sources come from web search only

3. **Expanded Authority Domains**:
   - Added financial institutions: Fidelity, Schwab, T. Rowe Price
   - Added regulators: CFTC, FINRA, FASB, IASB
   - Added news sources: Barron's, Morningstar, Seeking Alpha
   - Added industry publications: Hedgeweek, Alternative Investment platforms

4. **Word Count Scaling**:
   - 1750 words: 15 sources (default)
   - 2500+ words: 20 sources
   - 3000+ words: 25 sources

#### Implementation Status
- ✅ Web researcher enhanced with 5 queries, 10 results each
- ✅ Authority domains expanded from ~25 to 45+ domains
- ✅ Source limits increased and scaled by word count
- ✅ KB sources completely separated from citations
- ✅ Metadata validation updated to expect 8+ sources minimum

#### Expected Results
- Previous: 3-4 sources consistently
- New system: 10-25 sources based on word count
- Higher authority sources due to expanded domains
- True separation of KB insights vs web citations

## PRODUCTION SYSTEM STATUS - 2025-08-22

   - Reduces API connection overhead by ~10-15s

4. **Enhanced Fact Checker V2** (`src/agents/dakota_agents/fact_checker_v2.py`)
   - **Actually fetches web source content** for verification
   - Extracts all claims (citations, percentages, statistics)
   - Verifies each claim against source content
   - Requires 95%+ claim verification for approval
   - Tests URLs but allows some broken links (2+ working required)
   - Uses `gpt-4o-mini` for efficiency

5. **Web Research Validation** (`src/agents/dakota_agents/web_researcher.py`)
   - Filters sources by authority (government, major institutions, industry bodies)
   - 3-tier authority ranking system
   - Only includes sources from approved domains
   - No content verification (relies on domain authority)

#### Production Script
```bash
# Generate article with full fact checking
python scripts/generate_article_production_final.py "Your Topic" --word-count 800

# Test components
python scripts/generate_article_production_final.py --test
```

#### Output Files Generated
1. **Article** - `{prefix}-article.md` (main content with citations)
2. **Metadata** - `{prefix}-metadata.md` (SEO info, sources, verification status)
3. **Social Media** - `{prefix}-social.md` (multi-platform social content)
4. **Summary** - `{prefix}-summary.md` (executive summary)
5. **Metrics** - `generation_metrics.json` (performance tracking)

#### Factual Accuracy Implementation

- Content creation: ~31-36s (35-41% of total)
- Fact checking: ~6-7s (7-8% of total)
- Distribution: ~15-20s (18-22% of total)
- Total time: 80-95 seconds

#### IMPORTANT: No Mock Data
- KB search uses real vector store API
- Web search uses real search API (when configured)
- Fact checker fetches actual web content
- Only fallback messages shown on errors (not mock data)

## CRITICAL: Knowledge Base Usage Guidelines - 2025-08-22

### KB is NOT for Citations
The Dakota Knowledge Base should **NEVER** be used as a source for citations in articles. It serves only for:

1. **Style and Voice Guidance** - Understanding Dakota's tone and writing style
2. **Topic Generation** - Getting ideas for relevant topics
3. **Duplicate Prevention** - Ensuring topic wasn't recently covered
4. **Related Articles** - Finding Dakota articles to link in metadata section

### Current Issues with Source Count
- **Problem**: Only 3-4 sources appearing in metadata (should be 10-15)
- **Cause**: KB researcher times out, web search heavily filtered
- **Result**: Limited source diversity for fact checking

### Recommended Improvements

#### 1. Remove KB Sources from Citations (CRITICAL)
- Modify orchestrator to exclude KB results from citation sources
- Only pass web search results to content writer and SEO specialist
- KB results should only influence style and provide related articles

#### 2. Enhance Web Search Coverage
- Increase results per query: 5 → 10
- Add more search queries:
  - "[topic] institutional investors 2025"
  - "[topic] 2025 trends market data"  
  - "[topic] latest statistics 2025"
  - "[topic] research reports 2025" (NEW)
  - "[topic] industry analysis 2025" (NEW)

#### 3. Scale Sources by Word Count
```python
# Suggested source targets:
word_count <= 1000: 5-7 sources
word_count <= 2000: 8-12 sources  
word_count > 2000: 12-15 sources
```

#### 4. Expand Authoritative Domains
Add Tier 4 sources:
- Established industry journals
- University research centers (.edu)
- Recognized think tanks
- Reputable financial media (Financial Times, WSJ, etc.)
- Industry associations (.org)

#### 5. Current Source Limits
- Web search: Max 10 sources (after filtering)
- KB search: 0 sources (should not be used for citations)
- Total citations: Currently 3-4, should be 10-15

### Implementation Priority
1. **Fix KB source exclusion** - Stop using KB as citation source
2. **Increase web search results** - More queries, more results per query
3. **Relax authority filtering** - Include more reputable sources
4. **Scale with word count** - Adjust source count based on article length
