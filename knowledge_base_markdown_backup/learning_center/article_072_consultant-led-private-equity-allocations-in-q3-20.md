## Content

In recent months, institutional investors have continued to emphasize private equity allocations, with consultants playing a key role in guiding these decisions. Across U.S. public pension and retirement systems, substantial commitments were directed toward a range of investment strategies, reflecting an ongoing appetite for diversified growth opportunities. Major consulting firms, including Aksia, Hamilton Lane Advisors, StepStone Group, and others, steered significant capital into funds focusing on buyouts, growth equity, and alternative lending strategies. For example, Aksia facilitated over $3.8 billion in allocations, with the Virginia Retirement System leading with a $750 million commitment to GCM Grosvenor VRS VI. Similarly, Hamilton Lane's advisory role resulted in $2.9 billion in commitments, with New York State Common Retirement Fund investing $400 million in the Kohlberg Empire State Co-Investment Fund. These examples underscore the strategic shifts among institutional investors toward private markets as they seek yield enhancement and diversification amid a challenging economic landscape. While the involvement of specific consultants in these investment decisions is not always explicitly confirmed in public documents, it is assumed that they provided guidance or assistance based on their role as private equity or general consultants for the respective institutions. In this article, we’re breaking down the largest public pension allocations to private equity from top consultants for the third quarter of 2024. By the end of this list, you’ll be able to understand which consultants are making the largest allocations. 1.
