In the fast-paced world of investment sales, one thing remains crystal clear: You can’t raise money without first getting a meeting. Meetings are the backbone of capital raising, yet with inboxes overflowing, securing one isn’t as simple as it used to be. You're likely working with top-notch portfolio managers and sophisticated investors, people who are constantly bombarded with emails. So, how do you stand out? How do you ensure your email doesn’t get lost in the shuffle, but instead drives the recipient to hit “Reply”? The answer lies in the art of cold outreach. As we’ve mentioned before, the way to win with RIAs is cold outreach. Which is why having the right email is so important. In this article, we're going to outline how to craft an email designed to get a meeting. By the end of the article, you’ll know exactly what to include in the three parts to your email. Why Cold Outreach Matters in Investment Sales Cold outreach isn’t just an essential part of the job – it’s a lifeline for anyone in investment sales. The ability to connect with new prospects, build relationships, and expand your network relies heavily on your outreach efforts. A well-crafted email can be the difference between getting in front of a key decision-maker or being ignored altogether. Even though cold emails may feel daunting, they’re powerful tools when done right. They allow you to demonstrate your value, show respect for the recipient’s time, and most importantly, pave the way to new opportunities. The Email Formula That Works Every effective sales email contains three core elements: a strong subject line, a punchy body that communicates value, and a compelling call to action. Here’s how you can nail each of these components. 1. The Subject Line: Your Foot in the Door The subject line is your first (and sometimes only) chance to grab attention. Think of it as the hook – if it’s weak, your email won’t even get opened. But if it's sharp and to the point, you increase your chances of being noticed. For investment sales professionals, specificity is key. Instead of vague subject lines like “Looking to connect” or “Introduction,” go for something that immediately conveys purpose and urgency. For example, if you’ll be in New York on October 10th, your subject line might be: “Meeting Request: October 10th, 3:00 PM in NYC” This subject line works because it’s clear, direct, and shows that you have something specific in mind. 2. The Body: One Sentence, Big Impact Now that you’ve got their attention with a great subject line, your email’s body needs to deliver. But here’s where many sales professionals go wrong – they try to cram too much information into a single email. Long paragraphs about your firm’s history, performance metrics, and investment strategies won’t get read. Instead, focus on one concise, impactful sentence. This is what we call the "JP Morgan Private Bank test." Imagine the scenario: you’re delivering life-changing news to someone, and you need them to respond. Your sentence must be so compelling that it demands attention. For example: “Hi [Name], I’m [Your Name] with [Your Firm]. I’ll be in NYC on October 10th and would love to discuss how our strategy can help enhance your portfolio’s performance in the market.” This sentence is short but loaded with value – it introduces who you are, why you’re reaching out, and hints at the benefit they’ll gain from meeting you. 3. The Call to Action: Close the Deal Your closing statement should be clear and leave no room for a simple "no." Vague requests like “Can we meet sometime next week?” leave too much ambiguity and often lead to dead ends. Instead, provide a specific date and time, but with flexibility. For example: “Can you meet on October 10th at 3:00 PM?” This approach gives them the chance to either confirm or suggest an alternative, keeping the conversation going and increasing your chances of securing a meeting. Make Every Email Count As an investment sales professional, your livelihood depends on your ability to book meetings with qualified buyers. Your emails are your first impression – make them count. Remember to: Prioritize the subject line: It's your best shot at getting noticed. Keep the body short and impactful: Say just enough to pique their interest and convey value. Use a specific call to action: Give them a reason to say yes. Ultimately, effective cold outreach comes down to respecting the recipient’s time while communicating the value you bring. The more you refine your approach, the more meetings you’ll book, and the more opportunities you’ll create. Put these tips into practice, and watch your meeting count soar.
