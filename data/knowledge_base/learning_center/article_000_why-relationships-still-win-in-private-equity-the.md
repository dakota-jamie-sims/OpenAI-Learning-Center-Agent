As a founder of a SaaS business I have spoken to many smart and talented private equity investors. A question emerged during an episode of Dakota Way Sales Coaching: ‘Do you think in-person versus Zoom is better?’ From an efficiency standpoint, Zoom is best, but for building relationships and winning business, in-person meetings win every time. I’ve had hundreds of calls and meetings with private equity firms; the most impactful were face-to-face. In an era dominated by AI, relationships built through in-person interactions are crucial. That’s why City Scheduling is so valuable to deal sourcing—it’s your system for building in-person relationships at scale. AI can help identify targets and automate outreach, but it can’t sit across from a founder and build trust. Trust, rapport and gut instinct still close deals, so the smartest thing a BD professional can do is get in the room, shake hands and have real conversations. City Scheduling is a tactical approach where you proactively book 4–6 meetings in one metro area on a single day. You meet with CEOs in person to hear their stories and build authentic relationships. Zoom is useful, but nothing beats face-to-face when it comes to building long‑term founder relationships. Face-to-face meetings win because founders want to know who they’re dealing with; they’re entrusting their life’s work, and being present shows you take that seriously. Trust is a human emotion built through listening, eye contact, tone and presence, not automation. And in an AI‑saturated world where founders receive templated emails from dozens of funds, showing up in person becomes your differentiator. Dakota Marketplace integrates City Scheduling by breaking down private companies by city, industry and sector, and providing key information such as revenue and CEO contacts. With filters by metro area, you can quickly identify prospects and line up meetings. By following the City Scheduling playbook—picking five high‑priority cities, blocking one day for each, emailing ~30 CEOs per city and running five cities at a time—you build a constant rhythm of outreach and travel. This framework matters because while every PE fund is becoming more efficient and every CRM is getting smarter, very few professionals consistently sit down with founders. City Scheduling turns face‑to‑face meetings into a systematic practice, giving you an edge when deals are on the line. In a world of machines, being the human who shows up, listens and builds a relationship is how you stand out, source better and win deals.
