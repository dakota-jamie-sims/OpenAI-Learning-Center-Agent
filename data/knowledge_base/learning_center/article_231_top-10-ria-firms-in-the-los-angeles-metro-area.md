The RIA Channel is one of the most dynamic and fast growing channels for investment firms to sell their investment strategies to. The challenge has always been: what RIAs invest in outside managers and are not investment managers themselves? Through our Dakota Marketplace RIA database, we have aimed to solve that problem by curating and vetting each RIA by hand and only showing those RIAs that are true prospects for an investment firm. This saves both the investment sales team member time, but also saves the “other” RIAs that don’t allocate to other managers from getting unnecessary emails and phone calls. In this article we list the top RIAs in Los Angeles that we thought you might like to know. For a more detailed list of RIAs in Los Angeles click here to see for free. 1.
