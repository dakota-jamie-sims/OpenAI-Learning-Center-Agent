As an investment salesperson, we know it’s incredibly important to know exactly where public pension funds are making their investments. However, we also know that keeping up with those details can be quite a large undertaking for any given person, especially given the sheer number of pension funds across the country. At Dakota, we’ve been fundraising since 2006, and have raised over $40B for our partners in that time. We’ve made it part of our DNA to stay on top of public pension fund investments, and we want to help make these updates as accessible to our peers as possible. In this article, we’re breaking down the largest public pension allocations to Private Credit by General Consultants in 2021. By the end of this list, you’ll have a great starting point to fully understand which consultants are making the largest allocations. 1.
