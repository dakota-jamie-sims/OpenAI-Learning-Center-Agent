Staying up-to-date on where public pension funds are making their investments can be a critical part of an investment salesperson’s day to day. However, it can also be an incredibly time consuming task, given the sheer number of pension funds across the country. At Dakota, we’ve been fundraising since 2006, and have raised over $40B for our partners in that time. We’ve made it part of our DNA to stay on top of public pension fund investments, and we want to help make these updates as accessible to our peers as possible. In this article, we’re going to dive into ten of the largest public pension allocations made to Private Credit so far this year. By the end of this list, you’ll have a good jumping off point to better understand where funds are being allocated within the Private Credit space. 1.
