Perhaps a drop-off in RIA M&A was inevitable following a record fourth quarter and strong January in which Dakota tracked a record 43 deal announcements representing approximately $338.3B in client assets. Things significantly cooled down in February, with Dakota tracking 16 M&A deals representing approximately $32.6B in AUM. The month opened strongly, with Merchant Investment Management acquiring $20B Summit Financial , but in the end that deal made up over 60% of deal AUM for February. Cetera Financial Group closed out the month with the second largest deal, closing its acquisition of Protective Life 's Concourse Financial Group Securities , which added $4B in AUM (and $12B AUA). Whether the dip in M&A in February represents a pause or the beginning of a return to lower activity levels remains to be seen, but private equity interest in the space remains strong, as evidenced by Justin Ishbia -- co-owner of the NBA's Phoenix Suns with brother Mat -- reportedly seeking to get into the space by way of his Shore Capital Partners . And a sizable sale could be in the offing as well, with $6B NYC wealth manager Seven Bridges Advisors reportedly shopping a controlling stake. Dakota also tracked five RIA equity investments in the month, not far off January's tally of seven, including Sanctuary Wealth , which launched last year, making its first such investment and Rise Growth Partners staking $5.7B metro Boston RIA Grimes & Company .
