As an investment sales professional, you must attend conferences to meet with various advisors, consultants, and allocators to increase your touch points for raising capital. It can be a pain to research and keep track of the conferences that the many investment firms have. However, we both know it’s a non negotiable. At Dakota, our sales teams are constantly traveling, city scheduling, and making the most of every trip, whether it’s for a meeting or a conference. Then, what was once a shared calendar of upcoming events became a new feature in Dakota Marketplace called Dakota Conferences. This new feature allows not just our own sales team but all of our customers to see, at a glance, which conferences are happening and when, and what asset class they’re focused on. In this article, we’re outlining five upcoming conferences that focus on alternatives. By the end of the article, you’ll have a clear picture of upcoming events, when and where they’re being held, and if they’re a fit for your firm.
