To work in the investment management industry is a real gift. Whether it’s on the long-only side working with world-class stock pickers or on the private side working with investors who both know how to identify great companies and help grow them post investment, it’s an amazing industry. The jobs within the investment management industry range from fundraising, sales, investor relations, consultants relations, key accounts, foundations and endowments sales, analyst, portfolio management, operations, HR, finance, product marketing and product development just to name a few. What’s a little crazy is that there is constant turnover in the industry on the sales and distribution side of the business. Raising capital is tough, not to mention for an investment firm finding the right people to focus on the right channels for a specific strategy is not always easy. Throw in market volatility, and in some cases a lack of money in motion, investment firms get frustrated and can be quick to pull the trigger on sales people. This leads to the need for ease of finding job opportunities or openings. The problem, however, is finding the right opportunity is not that easy, because most investment firms are small to medium size businesses, and there are over 12,000 globally. Most opportunities are relationship driven introductions through each firm's network. Of course not all, but with so many firms out there, it’s not easy to find opportunities. One of the big reasons is that there has not been a dedicated job board focused exclusively on the investment management industry. Job boards tend to be general in nature and lack the specifics of the exact role investment firms are looking to fill. So the challenge stands - working in the investment management industry is a dream, but with a vast array of firms and no central place to find a role for your skill set, what is someone to do? We have identified a handful of job sites for you to review to see which ones might give you the opportunity to post a job and apply for a job within the investment management industry. Some are more general and some have a greater vertical focus. In this article we are reviewing the top job sites for investment management jobs. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding of each as well as pricing.
