In the month of February, Dakota tracked approximately $27B in fresh fundraising targeted for private equity – inclusive of buyouts, growth equity, and venture capital – and roughly $12B in new raises launched or planned for private credit funds. Notably, these estimates only include traditional closed-end, private institutional funds, and so do not account for the growing number of continuously-offered “evergreen” funds targeting private wealth investors. Among the more notable developments on that front, TPG announced plans to launch a new evergreen private equity vehicle along with its second GP-led secondaries fund in support of a $30B+ fundraising target for 2025. Swedish global manager EQT also launched a new evergreen infrastructure strategy, and Antares Capital debuted a private credit fund, both of which will be available to private wealth investors. Home equity fintech Nada also debuted what it says is a first-of-its kind fund providing professional and wealthy investors with exposure to the $35T US home equity market. Staying in Europe and the wealth channel, several Eltif 2.0-compliant funds also hit the market in February, as alternative managers look to tap into a private wealth market worth an estimated $42T to $45T: JP Morgan Asset Management launched the Eltif 2.0-compliant JPMorgan Eltifs – Multi-Alternatives Fund , which targets more than 1,000 private assets across over 15 sub-sectors, including private real assets, real estate, private credit and private equity. StepStone Group also joined the market upon receipt of regulatory approval to launch private credit-focused Eltifs with plans to initially market the funds in Italy, Spain, Germany, France and the Nordic and Benelux regions. Finally, Munich Private Equity expanded its private markets offering following approval from Germany's Federal Financial Supervisory Authority for its own Eltif 2.0-compliant fund.

By the end of this, you'll have a clear understanding of the key developments in private equity, private credit, and other alternative investments.
