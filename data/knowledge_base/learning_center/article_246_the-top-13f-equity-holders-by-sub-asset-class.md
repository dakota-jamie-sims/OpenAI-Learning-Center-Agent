With allocators taking advantage of tax loss selling in equities, and positioning their portfolios going into the end of Q4 2022 the main trend we observed in Marketplace via the 13F filings among RIAs, broker dealers and other filing entities was a broadening out of equity sub-asset classes. At the end of Q3 2022 over 52% of all equity ETF flows were captured across only three sub-asset classes. At the end of Q4 2022, this broadened out to 52% of all equity flows being captured across ten sub-asset classes.
