Over the past several years, the RIA industry has seen a dramatic rise in mergers and acquisitions, resulting in significant consolidation across the channel. This trend has been driven by private equity investment, advisor succession planning, and the increasing need for scale in areas like compliance, technology, and operations. As a result, RIA aggregators have emerged as dominant players, rapidly expanding and reshaping the independent wealth management landscape. At Dakota, we’ve been navigating the RIA space since 2006.

Best Practices for Navigating RIA Aggregators When selling to RIA aggregators, it's essential to understand their structure and decision-making processes. Each aggregator typically has a centralized home office research team responsible for curating approved lists of investment strategies, maintaining select lists and model portfolios, and managing access to alternative investments. These teams play a key role in gatekeeping investment opportunities on behalf of their advisory network and clients. However, many of these platforms also consist of individual underlying RIA teams or “child accounts” that conduct their own due diligence across asset classes. These teams can serve as important advocates for getting your strategy evaluated and ultimately placed on the platform. In Dakota Marketplace , we’ve listed both the centralized home office research contacts for each aggregator, as well as the underlying advisory teams. This visibility allows investment sales professionals to identify and prioritize the right points of contact, whether targeting the home office or starting with teams that can influence adoption from the ground up.
