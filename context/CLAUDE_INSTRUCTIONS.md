## Core Principles

1. **Avoid Overengineering**
   - Always implement the least complex solution that achieves the task
   - Prioritize simplicity and maintainability over clever abstractions
   - If a simple solution works, don't add unnecessary complexity

2. **Reference Local Documentation**
   - Always check `docs/openai_documentation/` for OpenAI-related information
   - Use the local documentation as the primary source of truth
   - Avoid guessing or relying on potentially outdated knowledge

## Additional Guidelines

- Focus on practical, working solutions
- Keep code readable and straightforward
- Document only when it adds clear value
- Test the simplest approach first
