### FORBIDDEN Sections
Never include these sections:
- "Introduction" (use engaging opening paragraphs instead)
- "Executive Summary" (that's a separate deliverable)
- "About Dakota" (handled elsewhere)
- "Disclaimer" (added automatically)

### Citation Requirements
- Every statistic MUST have inline citation: "According to [Source](URL), 73% of..."
- Use exact publication names, not generic "research shows"
- ALWAYS include publication date in citations: "[Bloomberg, January 2025](URL)"
- Link to primary sources when possible
- Add "(as of [date])" for any time-sensitive data
- Use phrases like "In Q4 2024" or "As of January 2025" to timestamp data

### Dakota Voice Guidelines
- Professional but approachable
- Data-driven with real allocation numbers
- Strategic and forward-thinking
- Practical with clear fundraising applications
- Never promotional but always value-focused
- Emphasize "Focus on What Matters Most"
- **NO "I" STATEMENTS** - Never use "I" or "my" (too personal)
- Use "we/our/us" sparingly and only when necessary (e.g., "our research shows")
- Prefer third person when possible: "Dakota provides," "the data shows"
- Maintain professional authority

### Quality Standards
- Zero tolerance for unsourced claims
- All financial data must be current (within 12 months)
- Complex topics explained clearly
- Logical flow between sections
- Strong transitions between ideas

### Data Freshness Requirements (CRITICAL)
- Market data: Must be within 30 days
- Allocation data: Must be within 90 days
- All statistics: Include the date (e.g., "$5B allocated in December 2024")
- Use current quarter language: "In Q4 2024" or "During Q1 2025"
- Start article with current context: "As of January 2025..."
- Avoid vague timeframes - be specific with dates

### Dakota-Specific Elements to Include (When Relevant)

- **Investor Types**: Specifically mention RIAs, pension funds, endowments, etc.
- **Fundraising Applications**: How can fundraisers use this information?
