If you’ve ever found yourself sifting through the SEC’s website in search of Registered Investment Adviser (RIA) data, you know it’s not exactly a walk in the park. The process can be clunky, frustrating, and anything but intuitive. We get it - nobody has time for that when you’re trying to crush your fundraising goals. That’s why Form ADV data, while incredibly valuable, often feels out of reach without the right tools. Form ADV is a treasure trove of information that RIAs are required to file with the SEC. It reveals details about their business practices, client bases, AUM, and more. This information is pure gold for fundraisers looking to build better outreach strategies, target the right prospects, and close more deals. At Dakota, we’ve taken this pain point and turned it into an opportunity with Dakota Marketplace. Think of it as the ultimate hack for making Form ADV data not only accessible but also actionable. No more endless scrolling or wrestling with an unfiltered search – our platform organizes everything into a filterable, searchable database designed to make your life easier. In this article, we're going to review the top Form ADV reports to leverage for fundraising efforts. By the end of this, you'll have a better understanding of these reports and how they can help you with your outreach efforts. 1. Custodians RIAs’ custodian choices directly impact whether an investment firm can engage with them. For example, if your firm is approved at LPL, you can only call on RIAs that custody at LPL. However, if an RIA uses Schwab or Fidelity, they are typically more flexible, allowing most investment firms to connect without requiring pre-approvals. How It Helps: This report enables you to focus your outreach on RIAs whose custodians align with your firm’s approvals, saving time and ensuring more meaningful conversations. 2. AUM – Discretionary vs. Non-Discretionary Not all AUM is managed the same way. RIAs with discretionary AUM can make investment decisions on behalf of their clients without prior approval, while those with non-discretionary AUM require client sign-off for every move. How It Helps: Targeting RIAs with discretionary AUM lets you engage decision-makers who can act swiftly. Meanwhile, understanding non-discretionary RIAs allows you to tailor your approach to help them sell your strategy to their clients. 3. Client Base RIAs’ client bases vary — some cater to pensions, others to high-net-worth individuals, or even retail investors. Each group has unique investment needs. How It Helps: This report helps you identify the type of clients an RIA serves, so you can position your strategy as the perfect solution. For example, pensions might require steady, risk-averse strategies, while high-net-worth clients may gravitate toward sophisticated or niche investments. 4. Selection of Outside Managers Some RIAs run internal investment strategies, while others rely on external managers to handle investments for their clients. This report highlights those outsourcing decisions. How It Helps: RIAs that outsource are prime candidates for your investment products. This report saves you from wasting time on RIAs unlikely to engage external funds, focusing instead on those already open to partnerships. 5. RIAs With Private Funds Private funds often act as feeder vehicles into larger investment opportunities. Identifying RIAs managing these funds is a powerful way to tap into these structures. How It Helps: This report pinpoints RIAs with experience managing private funds, making them ideal partners for sophisticated strategies or exclusive investment opportunities. 6. RIAs with Ultra-High Net Worth Clients RIAs serving ultra-high-net-worth clients work with individuals who can meet high investment minimums and are often open to sophisticated, high-potential strategies. How It Helps: This report allows you to focus your efforts on RIAs whose clients are more likely to align with your firm’s offerings. Whether it’s alternatives, private equity, or high-barrier-to-entry funds, these RIAs are great targets. 7. RIAs With Offshore Clients RIAs with offshore clients often manage investments for non-US individuals or entities. If your firm offers strategies in UCITs, these RIAs may be able to present them to their non-US clients. How It Helps: This report connects you with RIAs whose client base includes international investors, offering a way to expand your reach and diversify your fundraising opportunities.
