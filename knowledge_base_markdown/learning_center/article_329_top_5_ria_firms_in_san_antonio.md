If you're in investment sales, you likely already know that one of the biggest problems of selling to the RIA (Registered Investment Adviser) marketplace is the sheer size of it. The RIA market across the United States consists of over 36,000 firms, which means that while there are more than enough to choose from when looking for new clients, narrowing down the list to only those that allocate to outside managers is going to be key. Here at Dakota, we’ve raised over $6 billion from over 350 RIAs, and that has been possible because we qualify and curate our list to only RIAs that allocate to outside managers. In an effort to help narrow down the sheer size of the market, we’ve put together a list of the top 10 RIAs in each major metro area across the country. To determine our list, we looked for three things: An AUM above $200 million A dedicated analyst team An RIA that actively allocates capital to outside investment management firms We have qualified 5 RIAs with AUMs ranging from $3.6B to $115M in San Antonio that meet our criteria. Below are the top RIAs from that list. However, this is by no means a “best of” list, as there are so many high quality RIAs in San Antonio and around the country. We just wanted to give you a place to start. 1. Alamo Advisors AUM: $3,576,705,559 2. Sendero Wealth Management AUM: $1,800,385,944 In Sendero Wealth Management's words, their firm was created to serve you. Whether your needs are investment related, philanthropic or lean more toward business consulting and succession planning, they have the expertise to guide you. Their reputation of delivering personal attention and outstanding service is embodied in their high-client retention. 3. 1900 Wealth AUM: $1,320,449,977 From 1900 Wealth's website, they are wholly owned by Jefferson Bank. Since 1946, Jefferson Bank has operated with the attitude and principles of a Texas family business – because that’s exactly what it is. Jefferson Bank has been a strong part of the South Texas banking community for more than 75 years. It remains independent, locally-owned and ideally structured for convenient, personalized service. Today, the third-generation leadership is represented by A.J. “Jack” Lewis III, Steve C. Lewis, and Paul E. McSween III. 4. Aspireon AUM: $267,040,803 According to Aspireon, they deliver an advice centric, non-traditional wealth management experience. They're focused in raising the probability of success so their clients can pursue the things significant to them. 5. Glass Wealth Management AUM: $115,000,000 In Glass Wealth Management's own words, they provide investment services primarily for high-net-worth individuals, families, and related accounts. They're investors, not market timers. They design investment portfolios to endure throughout complete business cycles, through market peaks and troughs. Core to their investment approach is the belief that an investor must “know what you own and why you own it.” Hence, it is with deference to that mantra that a client portfolio seldom will hold any financial product. Their unwavering client focus, their size, and their location equip them to avoid the noise that often surrounds investment decisions and the financial industry.
