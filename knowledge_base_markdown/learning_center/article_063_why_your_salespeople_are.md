Many companies invest thousands, if not hundreds of thousands, of dollars into CRM systems like Salesforce. It’s a logical move: CRMs promise to streamline processes, provide actionable insights, and ultimately increase sales efficiency. But here’s the harsh reality: after all that money is spent, many companies face a serious problem - their sales teams simply don’t use it. Why does this happen? It comes down to two core problems we’ve seen time and again: improper configuration and stale, unreliable data. Both of these issues can cripple even the best CRM, turning what should be a valuable tool into an expensive headache. In this article, we’re going to address the two reasons why your CRM isn’t getting used by your sales people. By the end of this, you’ll have a better understanding as well as how to fix the issue at hand. So how do you save your company money as well as get a good ROI? Your answer is simple: the Marketplace for Salesforce App v.3.0. The Two Reasons Why Your Sales Teams Fail to Adopt Salesforce A CRM, no matter how advanced, is only as powerful as the people using it. If your sales team isn’t fully embracing Salesforce, it’s likely not their fault. In most cases, the problem lies in how the system has been set up. 1. It’s Not Configured for Your Team’s Needs Many companies start with a basic Salesforce setup, hoping the out-of-the-box features will be enough to get their team on board. But without customization, the CRM quickly becomes overwhelming. Too many fields, confusing data layouts, and irrelevant reports can make the system feel like more of a burden than a help. To address this, some companies hire third-party Salesforce Administrators, spending thousands more in the process. These administrators may be able to configure workflows and reports, but they don’t always understand the specific needs of your salespeople. As a result, the CRM ends up functional, but not actually useful for the people who rely on it most. When that happens, salespeople turn back to spreadsheets, emails, or even sticky notes, and your CRM starts to gather dust. 2. Data Gets Stale- and Fast One of the biggest issues with CRM systems is stale data. When your sales team doesn’t consistently use the CRM, the data quickly becomes outdated, leading to old leads, inaccurate contact information, and reports that don’t reflect the real pipeline. As data quality declines, leadership loses trust in the system, creating a vicious cycle - stale data leads to low usage, and low usage causes even more stale data. For investment sales professionals, this means missed opportunities and wasted time on non-sales activities. Instead of focusing on selling, your team spends hours manually updating records and chasing down information. And let’s be honest, when salespeople aren’t selling, your business isn’t growing. Meanwhile, Salesforce Administrators face the challenge of keeping up with a system that’s cluttered with irrelevant data, making it harder to maintain a clean, user-friendly CRM that meets the team’s evolving needs.
