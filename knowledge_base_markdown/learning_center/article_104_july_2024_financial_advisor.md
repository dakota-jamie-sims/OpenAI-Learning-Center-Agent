In July, Dakota followed notable mergers and acquisitions including KKR's acquisition of Janney Montgomery Scott and Sequoia Financial Group's purchase of Karpas Strategies, contributing to a continued trend of consolidation within the investment management sector. LPL Financial, UBS, and Raymond James have actively recruited numerous financial advisor teams, including high-profile advisors from firms like Morgan Stanley, Edward Jones, and Merrill Lynch, as these advisors seek to enhance their service offerings and independence. Wealth Enhancement Group, Robertson Stephens Wealth Management, and EP Wealth have significantly expanded their presence through strategic acquisitions, with Wealth Enhancement Group alone making multiple acquisitions across various states. Rockefeller Capital Management and Focus Financial Partners have also bolstered their positions by onboarding established advisory teams and merging partner firms, respectively. Overall, the independent wealth management landscape is seeing substantial growth as firms strengthen their capabilities and reach. One of the larger acquisitions this month, KKR, a leading global investment firm, and The Penn Mutual Life Insurance Company announced on July 23, 2024, a definitive agreement for KKR to acquire Janney Montgomery Scott LLC through its investment funds.

Post-transaction, Janney will become a standalone private company, continuing to operate independently. KKR plans to implement a broad-based equity ownership program for Janney's 2,300 employees, promoting team member engagement through ownership. This approach aligns with KKR's strategy of enhancing company strength through employee ownership, which has been applied to over 50 KKR portfolio companies since 2011. The deal is expected to close in the fourth quarter of 2024, pending customary closing conditions and regulatory approvals.
