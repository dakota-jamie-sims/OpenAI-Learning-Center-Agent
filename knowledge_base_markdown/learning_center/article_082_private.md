In the third quarter of this year, private credit continued to be a focal point for institutional investors, with a range of significant commitments guided by consultants across the U.S. public pension and retirement systems. These recommendations reflect the growing demand for alternative credit strategies, which have become an essential component of portfolio diversification amid economic uncertainty. Consultants such as RVK, Verus, Cambridge Associates, and others advised their clients to allocate substantial capital into credit funds spanning direct lending, opportunistic credit, and distressed debt. RVK, for instance, recommended over $1.3 billion in private credit investments, with New York State Common Retirement Fund leading the way with a $400 million commitment to the Empire Credit Co-Investment Fund. Similarly, New Jersey Division of Investment and Los Angeles-based pensions made substantial allocations to funds managed by Grosvenor, CVC Credit Partners, and Fidelity, among others. Other consulting firms, including Verus and Cambridge Associates, also steered institutional investors toward notable private credit funds. Verus oversaw allocations exceeding $550 million, highlighting Atalaya Special Opportunities Fund IX and Carlyle Direct Lending SMA, while Cambridge directed over $500 million into opportunities such as Atalaya and Primary Wave Music IP Fund 4. These commitments underscore the continued appeal of private credit as a tool for yield enhancement and diversification in pension portfolios.
